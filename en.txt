Foreword 
E I very once in a very long while in our 
field, a clinical innovation is introduced that profoundly improves patient care. 
Marsha Linehan's development of a cognitive-behavioral approach to bor­
derline personality disorder is such a rare innovation. I first discovered Dr. 
Linehan's work almost ten years ago around the time that she was beginning 
a series of systematic research studies to determine its efficacy. Even before 
the positive results were in, I felt sure that Dr. Linehan was on to something 
important. It has been my pleasure to observe as Dr. Linehan refined her tech­
niques, making them increasingly comprehensive, specific, practical, and ap­
plicable to general mental health practice. 
The problem Dr. Linehan is addressing—borderline personality dis­
order—is an important and prevalent one that represents a great clinical puz­
zle. These individuals suffer and cause suffering, often in the most poignant 
and dramatic fashion. They constitute the most frequent personality disorder 
encountered in clinical practice and have the highest rate of completed sui­
cide and of suicide attempts. Individuals meeting diagnostic criteria for bor­
derline personality disorder present a great treatment challenge. They are often 
recalcitrant, unpredictable, and get too close or stray too far in the therapeu­
tic relationship. They provoke strong countertransferences in the therapist who 
may become too seductive or too rejecting, or more likely may oscillate be­
tween these extremes. "Borderline" (what a terrible term, but we have failed 
to find a suitable replacement) individuals are also the most likely to have 
bad responses to treatment. They present, not infrequently, with a suicide 
attempt or self-mutilation made in response to a real or imagined rejection 
from their therapist (a vacation perhaps being the most common precipitant). 
They often tie the therapist in therapeutic knots so that every intervention 
feels wrongheaded and cruel hearted. The treatments typically end in a huff, 
and not infrequently in a hospitalization. 
Clinicians are most likely to feel bewildered and deskilled by the border­
line individuals in their practice, and search for ways of dealing with them.

vi Foreword 
For some clinicians, the major hope has been the discovery of an effective 
pharmacological intervention. The results to date have been decidedly mixed. 
There is no specific pharmacological treatment for the instability of border­
line patients, and even the medications (neuroleptics, antidepressants, lith­
ium, carbomezapine) most effective for accompanying target symptoms have 
their own side-effects and complications. Other clinicians have turned to psy­
chotherapeutic (particularly psychodynamic) strategies developed for border­
line individuals. But here, too, the results are quite mixed and the treatments 
have many side-effects and complications of their own (particularly the trans-
ference/countertransference reenactments described above). It is probably fair 
to say that individuals with borderline personality disorder constitute the 
toughest and most insoluble problem for the average clinician and the aver­
age clinic or inpatient facility. Everyone talks about borderline personality 
disorder but it usually seems that no one knows quite what to do about it. 
Until Dr. Linehan that is. She combines an unusually empathic under­
standing of the internal experience of borderline individuals with the techni­
cal tools of a cognitive/behavioral therapist. Dr. Linehan is a creative clinical 
innovator. She has analyzed the aspects of borderline behavior into their com­
ponent parts and has developed a systematized and integrated approach to 
each of them. Her techniques are clear, teachable, and learnable, and make 
good common sense to the therapist and to the patient. Dr. Linehan's methods 
have greatly improved my treatment of borderline individuals and my teach­
ing of others in how best to understand and treat these patients. I have no 
doubt that this book will change your practice and make you much more 
effective with these most troubled and needful individuals.

Acknowledgments 
T his book and this form of treatment, 
dialeaical behavior therapy (DBT), are the products of many minds and hearts. 
I have been influenced by most of my colleagues, students, and patients, and 
have appropriated the ideas of many. It would be impossible to cite everyone 
who has contributed, but I do want to acknowledge several whose influence 
has been enormous. 
First, I learned many of the most important elements of DBT from in­
dividuals who were my own therapists and consultants. The people to whom 
I have dedicated the book—Richard Gode, M.D., Allan Leventhal, Ph.D., and 
John O'Brien, M.D.—fall into this category, as does Helen McLean. I was 
fortunate indeed to find people so able to care so skillfully. Gerald Davison, 
Ph.D., and Marvin Goldfried, Ph.D., were my first clinical teachers in be­
havior therapy. They taught me most of what I know about clinical behavior 
change, and their ideas and influence pervade this book. My early training 
at the Buffalo Suicide Prevention and Crisis Service, Inc., has also had a strong 
influence; there, out of thin air, Gene Brockopp, Ph.D., created an internship 
for me when everyone else had turned me down. The therapy I have deve­
loped is in most respects an integration of my background in suicide preven­
tion and behavior therapy with my experience as a Zen student. My teacher, 
Willigis Jager, O.S.B. (Ko-un Roshi), a Zen master who is also a Benedictine 
monk, taught me, and still teaches me, most of what I know about acceptance. 
Much of the theoretical scaffolding of my approach to psychotherapy 
and borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a product of the swirl of ideas 
constantly circulating in the psychology department at the University of 
Washington. It is no accident that many of us here are arriving at similar points 
in quite diverse areas. I have been most influenced by the ideas of our resident 
radical behaviorist, Robert Kohlenberg, Ph.D.; the relapse prevention work 
of Alan Marlatt, Ph.D., and Judith Gordon, Ph.D.; and the developmental 
theories and clinical perspectives of Geraldine Dawson, Ph.D., John Gott­
man, Ph.D., and Mark Greenberg, Ph.D. Neil Jacobson, Ph.D., has also been

expanding many of the ideas in DBT, especially those concerning acceptance 
versus change, and applying them in the context of marital therapy. In a cir­
cular fashion, his creative ideas, especially his contextualizing of acceptance 
within a radical behavioral framework, have come back to influence the fur­
ther development of DBT. 
No professor can succeed, however, without an army of very bright and 
capable students prodding, arguing, critiquing, and offering new ideas and 
suggestions. Certainly that is true for me. Kelly Egan, Ph.D., my first doctor­
al student at the University of Washington, contributed many creative ideas 
to this therapy and shot down many of my less creative ones. I have had the 
joy of working with and supervising the clinical work of perhaps one of the 
finest groups of clinical graduate students to be found anywhere: Michael 
Addis, Beatriz Aramburu, Ph.D., Alan Furzzetti, Ph.D., Barbara Graham, 
Ph.D., Kelly Koerner, Edward Shearin, Ph.D., Amy Wagner, Jennifer Waltz, 
and Elizabeth Wasson. Jason McClurg, M.D., and Jeanne Blache, R.N., joined 
them in the clinical supervision seminar; because they came to the therapeu­
tic enterprise from medical rather than psychological backgrounds, they were 
able to add to and clarify the assumptions underlying DBT. Although I was 
ostensibly teaching all of these individuals DBT, in reality I was leaming much 
of it from them. 
When I began the field trials of this form of treatment, some aspects of 
the approach were quite controversial. My collaborator, Hugh Armstrong, 
Ph.D., ran interference. His immense personal and clinical respect in Seattle 
persuaded the clinical community to give us a chance. My research 
therapists—Douglas Allmon, Ph.D., Steve Clancy, Ph.D., Decky Fiedler, Ph.D., 
Charles Huffine, M.D., Karen Lindner, Ph.D., and Alejandra Suarez, Ph.D.— 
both demonstrated the effectiveness of DBT and found many of the flaws in 
the original manual. As a group, they embodied the spirit of a dialectical strate­
gy. The success of the clinical trial was due in large part to their ability to 
remain compassionate, level-headed, and close enough to the treatment manu­
al in the midst of exceptional stress. My research team and colleagues over 
the years—John Chiles, M.D., Heidi Heard, Andre Ivanoff, Ph.D., Connie 
Kehrer, Joan Lockard, Ph.D., Steve McCutcheon, Ph.D., Evelyn Mercier, Steve 
Nielsen, Ph.D., Kirk Strosahl, Ph.D., and Darren Tutek—have been invalu­
able in providing the support and many of the ideas that have nourished the 
development of a empirically grounded treatment for BPD. I do not believe 
I would have written this book if I had not had empirical data to back up 
the effeaiveness of the treatment. I would never have gotten those data without 
a first-class research team. 
My own patients often wonder what new treatment idea 1 am going to 
try out on them next. Over the years, they have shown marvelous patience 
as 1 fumbled around trying to develop this treatment. I have been encouraged 
by their courage and tenacity. In circumstances where many others would have 
quit long ago, not one of them has given up. They have been most gracious 
in pointing out many of my errors, noting the successes, and giving feedback

about how I could improve the treatment. The great thing about treating bor­
derline patients is that it is like having a supervisor always in the room. My 
patients have been very good and supportive supervisors indeed. 
I have many friends who are psychodynamic rather than cognitive-be­
havioral therapists. A number have contributed to my thinking and to this 
book. Charles Swenson, M.D., a psychiatrist at Cornell Medical Center/New 
York Hospital at White Plains, had the courage to try to implement DBT in 
an inpatient unit at a wholly psychodynamic hospital. We have spent count­
less hours discussing how to do it and how to overcome or circumvent 
problems. Out of those hours came a much sharper conceptualization of the 
treatment. John Clarkin, Ph.D., and Otto Kernberg, M.D., have compared 
and contrasted this treatment with Kernberg's over many discussions, and in 
the process nudged my thinking in directions I had perhaps resisted and helped 
clarify my stance in other ways. Sally Parks, M.A., a Jungian analyst and 
friend, has debated Jungian versus behavioral ideas with me for years, and 
much of my thinking about therapy evolved out of these debates. Finally, my 
good friend Sebem Fisher, M.A., one of the best therapists I know, has listened 
and shared her insights with me about the problems of borderline patients. 
The final draft of the book was written while I was on sabbatical in Eng­
land at the Medical Research Council Applied Psychology Research Unit, 
Cambridge University. My colleagues there—J. Mark Williams, Ph.D., John 
Teasdale, Ph.D., Philip Barnard, Ph.D., and Edna Foa, Ph.D.—critiqued many 
of my ideas and gave me new ones. Caroline Muncey saved my sanity by typ­
ing and retyping draft after draft. Leslie Horton, my secretary on the treat­
ment research project, also deserves much of the credit of organizing me and 
the materials that later became this book. 
I must thank my series editor, Allen Frances, M.D., for his sharp editing 
and insistence that I stay practical whenever possible. He provided the dia­
lectical opposition to the "ivory tower" that I sometimes work within. The 
interest in this therapy has been largely generated by his enthusiastic support 
over the years. My brother, W. Marston Linehan, M.D., who is also a research­
er, has never tired of helping me "keep my eye on the prize" so that I could 
get this book written. He and his wife, Tracey Rouault, M.D., and my sister. 
Aline Haynes, have been wonderfully supportive over the years. 
Development and writing of this volume were partially supported by 
Grant No. MH34486 from the National Institute of Mental Health. Morris 
Parloff, Ph.D., Irene Elkin, Ph.D., Barry Wolfe, Ph.D., and Tracie Shea, Ph.D. 
nurtured and fought for this work from the beginning, and deserve much of 
the credit for the success of the research on which this treatment approach 
is based. 
Last, but certainly not least, I want to thank my copy editor, Marie Spray-
berry. She worked miracles on the organization and clarity of this book, and 
with marvelous patience waited for me to come around to her better point 
of view on many matters of controversy.

Borderline Personality 
Disorder: Concepts, 
Controversies, and Definitions 
I n recent years, interest in borderline 
personality disorder (BPD) has exploded. This interest is related to at least 
two factors. First, individuals meeting criteria for BPD are flooding mental 
health centers and practitioners' offices. Eleven percent of all psychiatric out­
patients and 19% of psychiatric inpatients are estimated to meet criteria for 
BPD; of patients' with some form of a personality disorder, 33% of out­
patients and 63% of inpatients appear to meet BPD criteria (see Widiger & 
Frances, 1989, for a review). Second, available treatment modalities appear 
to be woefully inadequate. Follow-up studies suggest that the initial dysfunc­
tion of these patients may be extreme; that significant clinical improvement 
is slow, taking many years; and that improvement is marginal for many years 
after initial assessment (Carpenter, Gunderson, & Strauss, 1977; Pope, Jonas, 
Hudson, Cohen, & Gunderson, 1983; McGlashan, 1986a, 1986b, 1987). 
Borderline patients are so numerous that most practitioners must treat at least 
one. They present with severe problems and intense misery. They are difficult 
to treat successfully. It is no wonder that many mental health clinicians are 
feeling overwhelmed and inadequate, and are in search of a treatment that 
promises some relief. 
Interestingly, the behavior pattern most frequently associated with the 
BPD diagnosis —a pattern of intentional self-damaging acts and suicide 
attempts —has been comparatively ignored as a target of treatment efforts. 
Gunderson (1984) has suggested that this behavior may come closest to 
representing the "behavioral specialty" of the borderline patient. The empiri­
cal data bear him out: From 70% to 75% of borderline patients have a his­
tory of a least one self-injurious act (Clarkin, Widiger, Frances, Hurt, & 
Gilmore, 1983; Cowdry, Pickar, & Davis; 1985). These acts can vary in in-
--- Page 23 ---
4 THEORY AND CONCEPTS 
tensity from ones requiring no medical treatment (e.g., slight scratches, head 
banging, and cigarette burns) to ones requiring care on an intensive care unit 
(e.g., overdoses, self-stabbings, and asphyxiations). Nor is the suicidal be­
havior of borderline patients always nonfatal. Estimates of suicide rates among 
BPD patients vary, but tend to be about 9% (Stone, 1989; Paris, Brown, & 
NowHs, 1987; KroU, Carey, & Sines, 1985). In a series of BPD inpatients 
followed from 10 to 23 years after discharge (Stone, 1989), patients exhibit­
ing all eight DSM-III criteria for BPD at the index admission had a suicide 
rate of 3(>°/o, compared to a rate of 7% for individuals who met five to seven 
criteria. In the same study, individuals with BPD and a history of previous 
parasuicide had suicide rates that were double the rates of individuals without 
previous parasuicide. Although there are substantial literatures both on sui­
cidal and self-injurious behavior and on BPD, there is virtually no communi­
cation between the two areas of study. 
Individuals who intentionally injure or try to kill themselves and the BPD 
population have a number of overlapping characteristics, which I describe 
later in this chapter. One overlap, however, is particularly noteworthy: Most 
individuals who engage in nonfatal self-injurious behavior and most individu­
als who meet criteria for BPD are women. Widiger and Frances (1989) 
reviewed 38 studies reporting the gender of patients meeting criteria for BPD; 
women comprised 74% of this population. Similarly, intentional self-injuries, 
including suicide attempts, are more frequent among women than among men 
(Bancroft & Marsack, 1977; Bogard, 1970; Greer, Gunn, & Kolller, 1966; 
Hankoff, 1979; Paerregaard, 1975; Shneidman, Faberow, & Litman, 1970). 
A further demographic parallel of note is the relationship of age both to BPD 
and to nonfatal self-injurious behaviors. Approximately 75% of instances of 
self-injurious behavior involve persons between the ages of 18 and 45 years 
(Greer & Lee, 1967; Paerregaard, 1975; Tuckman & Youngman, 1968). Bor­
derline patients also tend to be younger (Akhtar, Byrne, & Doghramji, 1986), 
and BPD characteristics decrease in severity and prevalence into middle age 
(Paris et al, 1987). These demographic similarities, together with others dis­
cussed later, raise the interesting possibility that the research studies conduaed 
on these two populations, although carried out separately, have in fact been 
studies of essentially overlapping populations. Unfortunately, most studies 
of suicidal behaviors do not report Axis II diagnoses. 
The treatment described in this book is an integrative cognitive-
behavioral treatment, dialeaical behavior therapy (DBT), developed and evalu­
ated with women who not only met criteria for BPD but also had histories 
of multiple nonfatal suicidal behaviors. The theory I have constructed may 
be valid, and the treatment program described in this book and the compan­
ion manual may be effective, for men as well as for nonsuicidal borderline 
patients. However, from the outset, it is important for the reader to realize 
that the empirical base demonstrating the effectiveness of the treatment pro­
gram described here is limited to BPD women with a history of chronic parasui-

cidal behavior (intentional self-injury, including suicide attempts). (In keep­
ing with this, I use the pronouns "she" and "her" throughout this book to 
refer to a typical patient.) This group is perhaps the most disturbed portion 
of the borderline population; certainly it constitutes the majority. The treat­
ment is designed flexibly, such that as a patient progresses, changes are made 
in the treatment application. Thus, it is not unlikely that the treatment pro­
gram would also be effective with less severely disturbed individuals. But at 
the moment such an extension would be based on speculation, not well-
controlled empirical treatment studies. 
The Concept of Borderline Personality Disorder 
Definitions: Four Approaches 
The formal concept of BPD is relatively new in the field of psychopathology. 
It did not appear in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Dis­
orders (DSM) published by the American Psychiatric Association until the 
publication of DSM-III in 1980. Although the particular constellation of 
traits comprising the diagnostic entity was recognized much earlier, much of 
the current interest in this population has resulted from its recently gained 
official status. That status was not achieved without much controversy and 
dispute. The "official" nomenclature and diagnostic criteria have been arrived 
at both through political compromise and through attention to empirical 
data. 
Perhaps most controversial was the decision to use the word "border­
line" in the official designation of the disorder. The term itself has been popular 
for many years in the psychoanalytic community. It was first used by Adolf 
Stern in 1938 to describe a group of outpatients who did not profit from clas­
sical psychoanalysis and who did not seem to fit into the then-standard "neu­
rotic" or "psychotic" psychiatric categories. Psychopathology at that time was 
conceptualized as occurring on a continuum from "normal" to "neurotic" to 
"psychotic." Stern labeled his group of outpatients as suffering from a "bor­
derline group of neuroses." For many years thereafter, the term was used col­
loquially among psychoanalysts to describe patients who, although they had 
severe problems in functioning, did not fit into other diagnostic categories 
and were difficult to treat with conventional analytic methods. Different theor­
ists have viewed borderline patients as being on the borderline between neu­
rosis and psychosis (Stern, 1938; Schmideberg, 1947; Knight, 1954; Kemberg, 
1975), schizophrenia and nonschizophrenia (Noble, 1951; Ekstein, 1955), and 
the normal and the abnormal (Rado, 1956). Table 1.1 provides a sampling 
of early definitions of the term. Over the years, the term "borderline" gener­
ally evolved in the psychoanalytic community to refer both to a particular 
structure of personality organization and to an intermediate level of severity 
of personality funaioning. The term clearly conveys this latter notion.

6 THEORY AND CONCEPTS 
TABLE M. Borderline Conditions: Eariy Definitions and interrelationships 
Stern (1938) 
1. Narcissism—Simultaneous idealization and contemptuous devaluation of the 
analyst, as well as of other important persons earlier in life. 
2. Psychic bleeding—Paralysis in the face of crises; lethargy; tendency to give up. 
3. Inordinate hypersensitivity—Overreaction to mild criticism or rejection, so gross 
that it suggests paranoia, but falling short of outright delusion. 
4. Psychic and body rigidity—A state of tension and stiffness of posture readily ap­
parent to a casual observer. 
5. Negative therapeutic reaction—Certain interpretations by analyst, meant to be 
helpful, are experienced as discouraging or as manifestations of lack of love and 
appreciation. Depression or rage outbursts may ensue; at times, suicidal gestures. 
6. Constitutional feeling of inferiority—Some exhibit melancholia, others an infan­
tile personality. 
7. Masochism, often accompanied by severe depression. 
8. Organic insecurity—Apparently a constitutional incapacity to tolerate much stress, 
especially in the interpersonal field. 
9. Projective mechanisms—A strong tendency to externalize, at times carrying pa­
tients close to delusory ideation. 
10. Difficulties in reality testing—Faulty empathic machinery in relation to others. 
Impaired capacity to fuse partial object representations of another person into 
appropriate and realistic perceptions of the whole person. 
Deutsch (1942) 
1. Depersonalization that is not ego-alien or disturbing to the patient. 
2. Narcissistic identifications with others, which are not assimilated into the self but 
repeatedly acted out. 
3. A fully maintained grasp on reality. 
4. Poverty of objea relations, with a tendency to adopt the qualities of the other 
person as a means of retaining love. 
5. A masking of all aggressive tendencies by passivity, lending an air of mild ami­
ability, which is readily convertible to evil. 
6. Inner emptiness, which the patient seeks to remedy by attaching himself or her­
self to one after the other social or religious group, no matter whether the tenets 
of this year's group agree with those of last year's or not. 
Schmideberg (1947) 
1. Unable to tolerate routine and regularity. 
2. Tends to break many rules of social convention.

Gunderson (1984) has summarized four relatively distinct clinical 
phenomena responsible for the continued psychoanalytic interest over the years 
in the borderline population. First, certain patients who apparently functioned 
well, especially on structured psychological tests, nonetheless were scored as 
demonstrating dysfunctional thinking styles ("primitive thinking" in psy­
choanalytic terms) on unstructured tests. Second, a sizeable group of individu­
als who initially appeared suitable for psychoanalysis tended to do very poorly 
in treatment and often required termination of the analysis and hospitaliza­
tion.^ Third, a group of patients were identified who, in contrast to most 
other patients, tended to deteriorate behaviorally within supportive, inpatient 
treatment programs. Finally, these individuals charaaeristically engendered 
--- Page 27 ---
8 THEORY AND CONCEPTS 
intense anger and helplessness on the part of the treatment personnel dealing 
with them. Taken together, these four observations suggested the existence 
of a group of individuals who did not do well in traditional forms of treat­
ment, despite positive prognostic indicators. The emotional state of both the 
patients and the therapists seemed to deteriorate when these individuals en­
tered psychotherapy. 
The heterogeneity of the population referred to as "borderline" has led 
to a number of other conceptual systems for organizing behavioral syndromes 
and etiological theories associated with the term. In contrast to the single 
continuum proposed in psychoanalytic thought, biologically oriented theorists 
have conceptualized BPD along several continua. From their viewpoint, the 
disorder represents a set of clinical syndromes, each with its own etiology, 
course, and outcome. Stone (1980, 1981) has reviewed this literature exten­
sively and concludes that the disorder is related to several of the major Axis 
I disorders in terms of clinical characteristics, family history, treatment 
response, and biological markers. For example, he suggests three borderline 
subtypes: one related to schizophrenia, one related to affective disorder, and 
a third related to organic brain disorders. Each subtype occurs on a spectrum 
ranging from "unequivocal" or "core" cases of the subtype to milder, less eas­
ily identifiable forms. These latter cases are the ones to which the term "bor­
derline" is applied (Stone, 1980). In recent years, the tendency in the theoretical 
and research literature has been toward conceiving of the borderline syn­
drome as located primarily on the affective disorders continuum (Gunderson 
& Elliott, 1985), although accumulating empirical data cast doubt on this 
position. 
A third approach to understanding borderline phenomena has been la­
beled the "eclectic-descriptive" approach by Chatham (1985). This approach, 
embodied primarily at present in the forthcoming DSM-IV (American Psy­
chiatric Association, 1991) and Gunderson's (1984) work, rests on a defini­
tional use of borderline criteria sets. The defining characteristics have been 
derived largely by consensus, although empirical data are now being used to 
some extent to refine the definitions. For example, Gunderson's criteria (Gun­
derson & Kolb, 1978; Gunderson, Kolb, & Austin, 1981) were originally de­
veloped through a review of the literature and distillation of six features that 
most theorists described as characteristic of borderline patients. Zanarini, 
Gunderson, Frankenburg, and Chauncey (1989) have recently revised their 
BPD criteria to achieve better empirical discrimination between BPD and other 
Axis II diagnoses. However, even in this latest version, the methods of select­
ing new criteria are not made clear; they appear to be based on clinical criteria 
rather than empirical derivation. Similarly, the criteria for BPD listed in DSM-
III, DSM-III-R, and the new DSM-IV were defined by consensus of commit­
tees formed by the American Psychiatric Association, and were based on the 
combined theoretical orientations of the committee members, data on how 
psychiatrists in practice use the term, and empirical data collected to date.

10 THEORY AND CONCEPTS 
Interview for Borderlines —Revised (DIB-R) criteria, are listed in Table 1.2. 
A fourth approach to understanding borderline phenomena, based on 
a biosocial learning theory, has been proposed by Millen (1981,1987a). Mil-
Ion is one of the most articulate dissenters from the use of the term "border­
line" to describe this personality disorder. Instead, Millen has suggested the 
term "cycloid personality" to highlight the behavioral and mood instability 
that he views as central to the disorder. From Millon's perspective, the bor­
derline personality pattern results from a deterioration of previous, less se­
vere personality patterns. Millen stresses the divergent background histories 
found among borderline individuals, and suggests that BPD can be reached 
via a number of pathways. 
The theory I present in this book is based en a biosocial theory, and 
in many ways is similar to that of Millen. Both ef us stress the reciprocal 
interaction of biological and social leaming influences in the etiology of the 
disorder. In contrast to Millen, I have net developed an independent defini­
tion of BPD. I have, however, organized a number of behavioral patterns as­
sociated with a subset of borderline individuals—these with histories of 
multiple attempts to injure, mutilate, or kill themselves. These patterns are 
discussed in detail in Chapter 3; for illustrative purposes, they are outlined 
in Table 1.3. 
TABLE 1.3. Behavioral Patterns in BPD 
1. Emotional vulnerability: A pattern of pervasive difficulties in regulating negative 
emotions, including high sensitivity to negative emotional stimuli, high emotional 
intensity, and slow return to emotional baseline, as well as awareness and experience 
of emotional vulnerability. May include a tendency to blame the social environ­
ment for unrealistic expectations and demands. 
2. Self-invalidation: Tendency to invalidate or fail to recognize one's own emotional 
responses, thoughts, beliefs, and behaviors. Unrealistically high standards and ex­
pectations for self. May include intense shame, self-hate, and self-directed anger. 
3. Unrelenting crises: Pattern of frequent, stressful, negative environmental events, 
disruptions, and roadblocks—some caused by the individual's dysfunctional lifestyle, 
others by an inadequate social milieu, and many by fate or chance. 
4. Inhibited grieving: Tendency to inhibit and overcontrol negative emotional responses, 
especially those associated with grief and loss, including sadness, anger, guUt, shame, 
anxiety, and panic. 
5. Active passivity: Tendency to passive interpersonal problem-solving style, involv­
ing failure to engage aaively in solving of own life problems, often together with 
aaive attempts to solicit problem solving from others in the environment; learned 
helplessness, hopelessness. 
6. Apparent competence: Tendency for the individual to appear deceptively more com­
petent than she actually is; usually due to failure of competencies to generalize 
across expeaed moods, situations, and time, and to failure to display adequate 
nonverbal cues of emotional distress.

The Disorder: Concepts, Controversies, Definitions 11 
In general, neither behavioral nor cognitive theorists have proposed defini­
tional or diagnostic categories of dysfunctional behaviors comparable to the 
others described here. This is primarily a result of behaviorists' concems about 
inferential theories of personality and personality organization as well as their 
preference for understanding and treating behavioral, cognitive, and affec­
tive phenomena associated with various disorders rather than "disorders" per 
se. Cognitive theorists, however, have developed etiological formulations of 
borderline behavioral pattems. These theorisits view BPD as a result of dys­
functional cognitive schemas developed early in life. Purely cognitive theories 
are, in many respects, similar to more cognitively oriented psychoanalytic 
theories. The various orientations to borderline phenomenology described 
here are outlined in Table 1.4. 
Diagnostic Criteria: A Reorganization 
The criteria for BPD, as currently defined, reflect a pattern of behavioral, emo­
tional, and cognitive instability and dysregulation. These difficulties can be 
summarized in the five categories listed in Table 1.5. I have reorganized the 
usual criteria somewhat, but a comparison of the five categories I discuss be­
low with the DSM-IV and DIB-R criteria in Table 1.2 shows that I have re­
organized but not redefined the criteria. 
First, borderline individuals generally experience emotional dysregula­
tion. Emotional responses are highly reactive, and the individual generally 
has difficulties with episodic depression, anxiety, and irritability, as well as 
problems with anger and anger expression. Second, borderline individuals 
often experience interpersonal dysregulation. Their relationships may be cha­
otic, intense, and marked with difficulties. Despite these problems, border­
line individuals often find it extremely hard to let go of relationships; instead, 
they may engage in intense and frantic efforts to keep significant individuals 
from leaving them. In my experience, borderline individuals, more so than 
most, seem to do well when in stable, positive relationships and to do poorly 
when not in such relationships. 
Third, borderline individuals have patterns of behavioral dysregulation, 
as evidenced by extreme and problematic impulsive behaviors as well as sui­
cidal behaviors. Attempts to injure, mutilate, or kill themselves are common 
in this population. Fourth, borderline individuals are at times cognitively dys-
regulated. Brief, nonpsychotic forms of thought dysregulation, including de­
personalization, dissociation, and delusions, are at times brought on by 
stressful situations and usually clear up when the stress is ameliorated. Final­
ly, dysregulation of the sense of self is common. It is not unusual for a bor­
derline individual to report that she has no sense of a self at all, feels empty, 
and does not know who she is. In fact, one can consider BPD a pervasive 
disorder of both the regulation and experience of the self— a notion also pro­
posed by Grotstein (1987).

for BPD. 
There are a number of diagnostic instruments for BPD. The research tool 
that has been used most often is the original DIB, which was developed by 
Gunderson et al. (1981); it was recently revised by Zanarini et al. (1989), as 
noted earher. The criteria most commonly used for clinical diagnosis are those 
listed in the various versions of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, most 
recently DSM-IV. As Table 1.2 has shown, there is a substantial overlap be­
tween the DIB-R and the DSM-IV. This should come as no surprise, since 
Gunderson both developed the original DIB and was chair of the Axis II work 
group for DSM-FV. There are also a number of self-report instmments that are 
suitable for screening patients (Millon, 1987b; see Reich, 1992, for a review). 
The Concept of Parasuicidal Behaviors 
Much controversy has surrounded the labeling of nonfatal self-harm. Dis­
agreements generally revolve around the degree and kind of intent required 
(Linehan, 1986; Linehan & Shearin, 1988). In 1977, Kreitman introduced 
the term "parasuicide" as a label for (1) nonfatal, intentional self-injurious 
--- Page 33 ---
14 THEORY AND CONCEPTS 
behavior resulting in actual tissue damage, illness, or risk of death; or (2) 
any ingestion of drugs or other substances not prescribed or in excess of 
prescription with clear intent to cause bodily harm or death. Parasuicide, as 
defined by Kreitman, includes both actual suicide attempts and self-injuries 
(including self-mutilation and self-inflicted burns) with little or no intent to 
cause death.^ It does not include the taking of nonprescribed drugs to get 
high, to get a normal night of sleep, or to self-medicate. It is also distinguished 
from suicide, where intentional, self-inflicted death occurs: suicide threats, 
where the individual says she is going to kill or harm herself but has yet to 
act on the statement; almost suicidal behaviors, where the individual puts 
herself at risk but does not complete the act (e.g., dangling from a bridge 
or putting pills in her mouth but not swallowing them); and suicide ideation. 
Parasuicide includes behaviors commonly labelled "suicide gestures" and 
"manipulative suicide attempts." The term "parasuicide" is preferred over other 
terms for two reasons. First, it does not confound a motivational hypothesis 
with a descriptive statement. Terms such as "gesture," "manipulative," and "sui­
cide attempt" assume that the parasuicide is motivated by an attempt to com­
municate, to influence others covertly, or to try to commit suicide, respectively. 
There are other possible motivations for parasuicide, however, such as mood 
regulation (e.g., reduction of anxiety). In each case, careful assessment is 
needed —a necessity obscured by the use of descriptions assuming that such 
an assessment has already been conducted. Second, parasuicide is a less pejora­
tive term. It is difficult to like a person who has been labeled a "manipula­
tor." The difficulties in treating these individuals make it particularly easy 
to "blame the victims" and consequently to dislike them. Yet liking border­
line patients is correlated with helping them (Woollcott, 1985). This is a par­
ticularly salient issue, and 1 discuss it further in a moment. 
Research studies of parasuicide have typically employed a design in which 
individuals with a history of parasuicidal behaviors are compared to other 
individuals without such a history. Comparison groups might be other sui­
cidal groups, such as suicide completers or ideators; other, nonsuicidal psy­
chiatric patients; or nonpsychiatric control individuals. Although at times Axis 
I diagnoses are held constant, such a strategy is not the norm. Indeed, one 
of the goals of the research has been to determine which diagnostic categories 
are most frequently associated with the behavior. In only very recent data, 
and rarely at that, are Axis II diagnoses held constant or even reported. 
Nevertheless, in reviewing the parasuicide literature, one cannot help being 
struck by the similarities between the characteristics attributed to parasui­
cidal individuals and those attributed to borderline individuals. 
The emotional picture of parasuicidal individuals is one of chronic, aver­
sive emotional dysregulation. They appear to be more angry, hostile, and ir­
ritable (Crook, Raskin, & Davis, 1975; Nelson, Nielsen, & Checketts, 1977; 
Richman & Charles, 1976; Weissman, Fox, & Klerman, 1973) than nonsui­
cidal psychiatric and nonpsychiatric individuals and more depressed than both 
suicide completers (Maris, 1981) and other psychiatric and nonpsychiatric 
--- Page 34 ---

groups (Weissman, 1974). Interpersonal dysregulation is evidenced by rela­
tionships that are characterized by hostility, demandingness, and conflict 
(Weissman, 1974; Miller, Chiles, & Barnes, 1982; Greer et al., 1966; Adam, 
Bouckoms, & Scarr, 1980; Taylor & Stansfeld, 1984). Relative to others, para­
suicidal individuals have weak social support systems (Weissman, 1974; Slater 
& Depue, 1981). When asked, they report interpersonal situations as their 
chief problems in living (Linehan, Camper, Chiles, Strosahl, & Shearin, 1987; 
Maris, 1981). Patterns of behavioral dysregulation, such as substance abuse, 
sexual promiscuity, and previous parasuicidal acts are frequent (see Linehan, 
1981, for a review; see also Maris, 1981). Generally, these individuals are un­
likely to have the cognitive skills required to cope effectively with their emo­
tional, interpersonal, and behavioral stresses. 
Cognitive difficulties consist of cognitive rigidity (Levenson, 1972; Neu-
ringer, 1964; Patsiokas, Clum, & Luscomb, 1979; Vinoda, 1966), dichoto­
mous thinking (Neuringer, 1961), and poor abstract and interpersonal problem 
solving (Goodstein, 1982; Levenson & Neuringer, 1971; Schotte & Clum, 
1982). Impairments in problem solving may be related to deficits in specific 
(as compared to general) episodic memory capabilities (Williams, 1991), which 
have been found to characterize parasuicidal patients when compared to other 
psychiatric patients. My colleagues and I have found that parasuicidal individu­
als exhibit a more passive (or dependent) interpersonal problem-solving style 
(Linehan et al., 1987). In the face of their emotional and interpersonal diffi­
culties, many of these individuals report that their behavior is designed to 
provide an escape from what, to them, seems like an intolerable and unsolv-
able life. A comparison of borderline and parasuicidal individual characteris­
tics is shown in Table 1.5. 
The Overlap Between Borderline Personality 
Disorder and Parasuicidal Behavior 
As I have noted earlier, much of my treatment research and clinical work has 
been with the chronically parasuicidal individual who also meets criteria for 
BPD. From my vantage point, these particular individuals meet the criteria 
for BPD in a unique way. They seem more depressed than one might expect 
from DSM-IV criteria. They also often exhibit overcontrol and inhibition of 
anger, which are not discussed in either DSM-IV or the DIB-R. I do not view 
these patients in the pejorative terms suggested by both DSM-IV and the DIB-
R. My clinical experience and reasoning on each of these issues are as follows. 
Emotion Dysregulation: Depression 
"Affective instability" in DSM-IV refers to marked reactivity of mood caus­
ing episodic depression, irritability, or anxiety, usually lasting a few hours 
and only rarely more than a few days. The implication here is that the base-
--- Page 35 ---
16 THEORY AND CONCEPTS 
line mood is not particularly negative or depressed. In my experience with 
parasuicidal borderline individuals, however, their baseline affective state is 
generally extremely negative, at least with respect to depression. For exam­
ple, in a sample of 41 women at my clinic who met criteria for both BPD 
and recent parasuicidal behavior, 71% met criteria for major affective dis­
order and 24% met criteria for dysthymia. In our most recent treatment study 
(Linehan, Armstrong, Suarez, Allman, & Heard, 1991), my colleagues and 
I were amazed at the apparent stability over a 1-year period of self-reports 
of depression and hopelessness. Thus, the DIB-R with its emphasis on chronic 
depression, hopelessness, worthlessness, guilt, and helplessness, seems to 
characterize parasuicidal borderline individuals better than the DSM-IV does. 
Emotion Dysregulation: Anger 
Both the DSM-IV and the DIB-R emphasize problems with anger dyscontrol 
in borderline functioning. Frequent, intense anger and angry acts are included 
in both sets of criteria. Our clinic of parasuicidal borderline patients certain­
ly includes a number of individuals who meet this requirement. However, it 
also includes a number of other individuals who are characterized by over-
control of angry feelings. These individuals rarely if ever display anger; in­
deed, they display a pattern of passive and submissive behaviors when anger, 
or at least assertive behavior, would be appropriate. Both groups have trou­
ble with anger expression, but one group overexpresses anger and one group 
underexpresses it. In the latter case, underexpression is at times related to 
a history of previous overexpression of anger. In almost all cases, the under-
expressive borderline individuals have marked fear and anxiety about anger 
expression; at times they fear that they will lose control if they express even 
the slightest anger, and at other times they fear that targets of even minor 
anger expression will retaliate. 
Manipulation and Other Pejorative Descriptors 
Both the DIB-R and the DSM-IV stress so-called "manipulative" behavior 
as part of the borderline syndrome. Unfortunately, in neither set of criteria 
is it particularly clear how one would operationally define such behavior. The 
verb "manipulate" is defined as "to influence or manage shrewdly or devi­
ously" in the American Heritage Dictionary (Morris, 1979, p. 794) and as 
"to manage or control artfully or by shrewd use of influence, often in an un­
fair or fraudulent way" by Webster's Neia World Dictionary (Guralnik, 1980, 
p. 863). Both definitions suggest that the manipulating individual intends to 
influence another person by indirect, insidious, or devious means. 
Is this typical behavior of borderline individuals? In my own experience, 
it has not been. Indeed, when they are trying to influence someone, border­
line individuals are typically direct, forceful, and, if anything, unartful. It is 
surely the case that borderline individuals do influence others. Often the most 
--- Page 36 ---
The Disorder: Concepts, Controversies, Definitions 17 
influential behavior is parasuicide or the threat of impending suicide; at other 
times, the behaviors that have the most influence are communications of in­
tense pain and agony, or current crises that the individuals cannot solve them-
self. Such behaviors and communications, of course, are not by themselves 
evidence of manipulation. Otherwise, we would have to say that people in 
pain or crises are "manipulating" us if we respond to their communications 
of distress. The central question is whether or not borderline individuals pur­
posely use these behaviors or communications to influence others artfully, 
shrewdly, and fraudulently. Such an interpretation is rarely in accord with 
borderline individuals' own self-perceptions of their intent. Since behavioral 
intent can only be measured by self-report, to maintain that the intent is present 
in spite of the individuals' denial would require us either to view borderline 
individuals as chronic liars or to construa a notion of unconscious behavioral 
intent. 
It is difficult to answer contentions by some theorists that borderline in­
dividuals frequently lie. With one exception, that has not been my experience. 
The exception has to do with use of illicit and prescription drugs in an en­
vironment that is highly controlling of drugs, a topic that is discussed later 
in Chapter 15. My own experience in working with suicidal borderline pa­
tients has been that the frequent interpretation of their suicidal behavior as 
"manipulative" is a major source of their feelings of invalidation and of being 
misunderstood. From their own point of view, suicidal behavior is a reflec­
tion of serious and at times frantic suicide ideation and ambivalence over 
whether to continue life or not. Although the patients' communication of ex­
treme ideas or enactment of extreme behaviors may be accompanied by the 
desire to be helped or rescued by the persons they are communicating with, 
this does not necessarily mean that they are acting in this manner in order 
to get help. 
These individuals' numerous suicidal behaviors and suicide threats, ex­
treme reactions to criticism and rejection, and frequent inability to articulate 
which of a number of factors are directly influencing their own behavior do 
at times make other people feel manipulated. However, inferring behavioral 
intent from one or more of the effects of the behavior—in this case, making 
others feel manipulated —is simply an error in logic. The fact that a behavior 
is influenced by its effects on the environment ("operant behavior," in be­
havioral terms) says little if anything about an individual's intent with respect 
to that behavior. Function does not prove intention. For example, a person 
may quite predictably threaten suicide whenever criticized. If the criticism then 
always turns to reassurance, we can be quite confident that the relationship 
between criticism and suicide threats will grow. However, the fact of the corre­
lation in no way implies that the person is trying or intending to change the 
criticizer's behavior with threats, or is even aware of the correlation. Thus, 
the behavior is not manipulative in any standard use of the term. To say then 
that the "manipulation" is unconscious is a tautology based on clinical infer­
ence. Both the pejorative nature of such inferences and the low reliability of 
--- Page 37 ---
18 THEORY AND CONCEPTS 
clinical inferences in general (see Mischel, 1968, for a review) make such a 
practice unwarranted in most cases. 
There are a number of other uses of pejorative terminology in both the 
DIB-R and the DSM-IV. For example, one proposed criterion of unstable self-
image for the DSM-IV included the following sentence: "Typically this in­
volves the shift from being a needy supplicant for help to being a righteous 
and vengeful victim." Let us take first the term "righteous and vengeful vic­
tim." Use of such a term suggests that such a stance is somehow dysfunction­
al or pathological. However, the recent evidence that up to 76% of women 
meeting criteria for BPD are indeed victims of sexual abuse during childhood, 
together with the evidence for neglect and physical abuse suffered by these 
individuals (see Chapter 2 for reviews of these data), suggests that such a 
stance is isomorphic with reality. 
Or let us examine the term "needy." It does not seem unreasonable for 
a person in intense pain to present as a "needy supplicant." Indeed, such a 
stance may be essential if the person is to get what is needed to ameliorate 
the current painful condition. This is especially the case when resources are 
scarce in general, or when the applicant for help does not have sufficient 
resources to "buy" the needed help —both of which are often true of border­
line individuals. We in the mental health community have few resources to 
help them. What little help we can give them is limited by other obligations 
and demands on our time and lives as individual caregivers. Often, what bor­
derline patients want the most—our time, attention, and care —are available 
only in brief, rationed hours of the week. Nor do borderline individuals have 
the interpersonal skills to find, develop, and maintain other interpersonal rela­
tionships where they might get more of what they need. To say that needing 
more than others can reasonably give is being too "needy" seems to cut too 
wide a swath. When burn or cancer patients in extreme pain act in a similar 
manner, we do not usually call them "needy supplicants." My guess is that 
if we withheld pain medicine from them, they would vacillate in exactly the 
same manner as borderline individuals. 
The case can be made that in the minds of professional caregivers, these 
terms are not pejorative; indeed, that might be true. However, it seems to 
me that such pejorative terms do not themselves increase compassion, 
understanding, and a caring attitude for borderline patients. Instead, for many 
therapists such terms create emotional distance from and anger at borderline 
individuals. At other times, such terms reflect already rising emotional 
distance, anger, and frustration. One of the main goals of my theoretical 
endeavors has been to develop a theory of BPD that is both scientifically 
sound and nonjudgmental and nonpejorative in tone. The idea here is that 
such a theory should lead to effective treatment techniques as well as to a 
compassionate attitude. Such an attitude is needed, especially with this 
population: Our tools to help them are limited; their misery is intense and 
vocal; and the success or failure of our attempts to help can have extreme 
outcomes.

Therapy for Borderline Personality Disorder: 
A Preview 
The treatment program I have developed —dialectical behavior therapy or 
DBT— is, for the most part, the application of a broad array of cognitive and 
behavior therapy strategies to the problems of BPD, including suicidal be­
haviors. The emphasis on assessment; data collection on current behaviors; 
precise operational definition of treatment targets; a collaborative working 
relationship between therapist and patient, including attention to orienting 
the patient to the therapy program and mutual commitment to treatment goals; 
and application of standard cognitive and behavior therapy techniques all sug­
gest a standard cognitive-behavioral therapy program. The core treatment 
procedures of problem solving, exposure techniques, skill training, contin­
gency management, and cognitive modification have been prominent in cog­
nitive and behavior therapy for years. Each set of procedures has an enormous 
empirical and theoretical literature. 
DBT also has a number of distinctive defining characteristics. As its name 
suggests, its overriding characteristic is an emphasis on "dialectics"—that is, 
the reconciliation of opposites in a continual process of synthesis. The most 
fundamental dialectic is the necessity of accepting patients just as they are 
within a context of trying to teach them to change. The tension between pa­
tients' alternating, excessively high and low aspirations and expectations rela­
tive to their own capabilities offers a formidable challenge to therapists; it 
requires moment-to-moment changes in the use of supportive acceptance 
versus confrontation and change strategies. This emphasis on acceptance as 
a balance to change flows directly from the integration of a perspective drawn 
from Eastern (Zen) practice with Western psychological practice. The term 
dialectics also suggests the necessity of dialectical thinking on the part of the 
therapist, as well as of targeting for change nondialectical, dichotomous, and 
rigid thinking on the part of the patient. Stylistically, DBT blends a matter-
of-fact, somewhat irreverent, and at times outrageous attitude about current 
and previous parasuicidal and other dysfunctional behaviors with therapist 
warmth, flexibility, responsiveness to the patient, and strategic self-disclosure. 
The continuing efforts in DBT to "reframe" suicidal and other dysfunctional 
behaviors as part of the patient's learned problem-solving repertoire, and to 
focus therapy on active problem solving, are balanced by a corresponding 
emphasis on validating the patient's current emotional, cognitive, and be­
havioral responses just as they are. The problem-solving focus requires that 
the therapist address all problematic patient behaviors (in and out of sessions) 
and therapy situations in a systematic manner, including conducting a col­
laborative behavioral analysis, formulating hypotheses about possible vari­
ables influencing the problem, generating possible changes (behavioral 
solutions), and trying out and evaluating the solutions. 
Emotion regulation, interpersonal effectiveness, distress tolerance, core 
mindfulness, and self-management skills are actively taught. In all modes of 
--- Page 39 ---
20 THEORY AND CONCEPTS 
treatment, the application of these skills is encouraged and coached. The use 
of contingencies operating within the therapeutic environment requires the 
therapist to pay close attention to the reciprocal influence that each participant, 
therapist and patient, has on the other. Although natural contingencies are 
highlighted as a means of influencing patient behavior, the therapist is not 
prohibited from using arbitrary reinforcers as well as aversive contingencies 
when the behavior in question is lethal or the behavior required of the pa­
tient is not readily produced under ordinary therapeutic conditions. The ten­
dency of borderline patients to actively avoid threatening situations is a 
continuing focus of DBT. Both in-session and in vivo exposure to fear-eliciting 
stimuli are arranged and encouraged. The emphasis on cognitive modifica­
tion is less systematic than in pure cognitive therapy, but such modification 
in encouraged both in ongoing behavioral analysis and in the prompting of 
change. 
The focus on validating requires that the DBT therapist search for the 
grain of wisdom or truth inherent in each of the patient's responses and com­
municate that wisdom to the patient. A belief in the patient's essential desire 
to grow and progress, as well as a belief in her inherent capability to change, 
underpins the treatment. Validation also involves frequent, sympathetic ac­
knowledgment of the patient's sense of emotional desperation. Throughout 
treatment, the emphasis is on building and maintaining a positive, interper­
sonal, collaborative relationship between patient and therapist. A major 
characteristic of the therapeutic relationship is that the primary role of the 
therapist is as consultant to the patient, not as consultant to other individuals. 
Differences Between This Approach and 
Standard Cognitive and Behavior Therapies 
A number of aspects of DBT set it off from "usual" cognitive and behavior 
therapy: (1) the focus on acceptance and validation of behavior as it is in the 
moment; (2) the emphasis on treating therapy-interfering behaviors; (3) the 
emphasis on the therapeutic relationship as essential to the treatment; and 
(4) the focus on dialectical processes. First, DBT emphasizes acceptance of 
behavior and reality as it is more than do most cognitive and behavior ther­
apies. To a great extent, in fact, standard cognitive-behavioral therapy can 
be thought of as a technology of change. It derives many of its techniques 
from the field of learning, which is the study of behavioral change through 
experience. In contrast, DBT emphasizes the importance of balancing change 
with acceptance. Although acceptance of patients as they are is crucial to any 
good therapy, DBT goes a step further than standard cognitive-behavioral 
therapy in emphasizing the necessity of teaching patients to accept themselves 
and their world as it is in the moment. Thus, a technology of acceptance is 
as important as the technology of change. 
This emphasis in DBT on a balance of acceptance and change owes much 
to my experiences in studying meditation and Eastern spirituality The DBT 
--- Page 40 ---
The Disorder: Concepts, Controversies, Definitions 21 
tenets of observing, mindfulness, and avoidance of judgment are all derived 
from the study and practice of Zen meditation. The behavioral treatment most 
similar to DBT in this respect is Hayes's (1987) contextual psychotherapy. 
Hayes is a radical behavior therapist who also emphasizes the necessity of 
behavioral acceptance. A number of other theorists are applying these prin­
ciples to specific problem areas and have influenced the development of DBT. 
Marlatt and Gordon (1985), for example, teach mindfulness to alcohohcs, 
and Jacobson (1991) has recently begun to systematically teach acceptance 
to distressed marital couples. 
The emphasis in DBT on therapy-interfering behaviors is more similar 
to the psychodynamic emphasis on "transference" behaviors than it is to any 
aspect of standard cognitive-behavioral therapies. Generally, behavior ther­
apists have given little empirical attention to the treatment of behaviors that 
interfere with the therapy. The exception here is the large literature on treat­
ment compliance behaviors (e.g., Shelton & Levy, 1981). Other approaches 
to the problem have been generally handled under the rubric of "shaping," 
which has received a fair amount of attention in the treatment of children, 
chronic psychiatric inpatients, and the mentally retarded (see Masters, Bur-
ish, Hollon, & Rimm, 1987). This is not to say that the problem has been 
ignored completely. Chamberlain and her colleagues (Chamberlain, Patter­
son, Reid, Kavanagh, & Forgatch, 1984) have even developed a measure of 
treatment resistance for use with families undergoing her behavioral family 
interventions. 
My emphasis on the therapeutic relationship as crucial to progress in 
DBT comes primarily from my work in interventions with suicidal individu­
als. At times, this relationship is the only thing that keeps them alive. Be­
havior therapists attend to the therapeutic relationship (see Linehan, 1988, 
for a review of this literature), but have not historically given it the promi­
nence that I give it in DBT. Kohlenberg and Tsai (1991) have recently deve­
loped an integrated behavioral therapy in which the vehicle of change is the 
relationship between therapist and patient; their thinking has influenced the 
development of DBT. Cognitive therapists, while always noting its importance, 
have written little about how to achieve the collaborative relationship viewed 
as necessary to the therapy. An exception here is the recent book by Safran 
and Segal (1990). 
Finally, the focus on dialectical processes (which I discuss in detail in 
Chapter 2) sets DBT off from standard cognitive-behavioral therapy, but not 
as much as it appears at first glance. Similar to behavior therapy, dialectics 
stresses process over structure. Recent advances in radical behaviorism and 
contextual theories and the approaches to behavior therapy they have gener­
ated (e.g., Hayes, 1987; Kohlenberg & Tsai, 1992; Jacobson, 1992) share many 
characteristics of dialectics. The newer information-processing approaches 
to cognitive therapy (e.g., WiUiams, in press) also emphasize process over struc­
ture. DBT, however, takes the application of dialectics substantially further 
than do many standard cognitive and behavior therapies. The force of the 
--- Page 41 ---
22 THEORY AND CONCEPTS 
dialectical tone in determining therapeutic strategies at any given moment is 
substantial. The emphasis on dialectics in DBT is most similar to the ther­
apeutic emphasis in Gestalt therapy, which also springs from a wholistic, sys­
tems theory and focuses on ideas such as synthesis. Interestingly, the newer 
cognitive therapy approaches to BPD developed by Beck and his colleagues 
(Beck, Freeman, & Associates, 1990; Young, 1988) explicitly incorporate 
Gestalt techniques. 
Whether these differences are fundamentally important is, of course, an 
empirical question. Certainly, when all is said and done, the standard 
cognitive-behavioral components may be the ones most responsible for the 
effectiveness of DBT. Or, as cognitive and behavior therapies expand their 
scope, we may find that the differences between DBT and more standard ap­
plications are not as sharp as I suggest. 
Is the Treatment Effective?: The Empirical Data 
At this writing, DBT is one of the few psychosocial interventions for BPD 
that have controlled, empirical data supporting its actual effectiveness. Given 
the immense difficulties in treating these patients, the literature on how to 
treat them, and the widespread interest in the topic, this is rather surprising. 
I have been able to find only two other treatments that have been subjected 
to a controlled clinical trial. Marziali and Munroe-Blum (1987; Munroe-Blum 
& Marziah, 1987, 1989; Clarkin, MarziaH, & Munroe-Blum, 1991) com­
pared a psychodynamic group therapy for BPD (Relationship Management 
Psychotherapy, RMP) to individual-treatment-as-usual in the community. They 
found no differences in treatment outcome although RMP was somewhat more 
successful in keeping patients in therapy. Turner (1992) has recently completed 
a randomized controlled trial of a structured, multimodal treatment consist­
ing of pharmacotherapy combined with an integrative dynamic/cognitive-
behavioral treatment, quite similar to DBT. Preliminary results indicate promis­
ing outcomes, with gradual reductions reported in problematic cognitions and 
behaviors, anxiety, and depression. 
Two clinical trials have been conducted on DBT. In both, chronically 
parasuicidal women meeting criteria for BPD were randomly assigned to DBT 
or to a community treatment-as-usual control condition. Therapists includ­
ed myself as well as other psychologists, psychiatrists, and mental health profes­
sionals trained and supervised by me in DBT. The research treatment lasted 
for 1 year. Assessments were conduaed every 4 months until posttreatment. 
Following treatment, two assessments were conducted at 6-month intervals. 
Study I 
In the first study, 24 subjects were assigned to DBT and 23 were assigned 
to treatment-as-usual. Except when looking at treatment drop-out rates, only 
those DBT subjects who stayed in treatment for four or more sessions [n = 
--- Page 42 ---
The Disorder: Concepts, Controversies, Definitions 23 
22) were included in analyses. One treatment-as-usual subject never came back 
for assessments. Results favoring DBT were found in each target area. 
1. Compared to treatment-as-usual subjeas, subjects assigned to DBT 
were significantly less likely to engage in parasuicide at all during the treat­
ment year, reported fewer parasuicide episodes at each assessment point, and 
had less medically severe parasuicides over the year. These results obtained 
in spite of the fact that DBT was no better than treatment-as-usual at im­
proving self-reports of hopelessness, suicide ideation, or reasons for living. 
Similar reductions in frequency of parasuicide episodes were found by Barley 
et al. (in press) when they instituted DBT on a psychiatric inpatient unit. 
2. DBT was more effective than treatment-as-usual at hmiting treatment 
dropout, the most serious therapy-interfering behavior. At one year, only 
16.4% had dropped out, considerably fewer than the 50-55% who drop out 
of other treatments by that time (see Koenigsberg, Clarkin, Kernberg, Yeo-
mans, & Gutfreund, in press). 
3. Subjects assigned to DBT had a tendency to enter psychiatric units 
less often and had fewer inpatient psychiatric days per patient. Those in DBT 
had an average of 8.46 psychiatric inpatient days over the year compared to 
38.86 for subjects assigned to treatment-as-usual. 
In many clinical treatment studies, subjects who either attempt suicide 
or are hospitalized for psychiatric reasons are dropped from the clinical trial. 
Thus, I was particularly interested in looking at these two outcomes jointly. 
A system was developed to categorize psychological functioning on a con­
tinuum from poor to good as follows: Subjects who had no psychiatric 
hospitalization and no parasuicide episodes during the last four months of 
their treatment were labeled "good." Those with either a hospitalization or 
a parasuicide episode were labeled "moderate," and those with both a hospitali­
zation and a parasuicide episode during the last four months of treatment, 
as well as the one subject who suicided, were labeled poor. Using this sys­
tem, 13 DBT subjects had good outcomes, 6 had moderate outcomes, and 
3 had poor outcomes. In the treatment-as-usual condition, there were 6 each 
with good and with poor outcomes and 10 with moderate outcomes. The 
difference in outcome was significant at the p < .02 level. 
4. At termination of treatment, DBT subjects, compared to subjects in 
treatment-as-usual, were rated higher on global adjustment by an interview­
er and rated themselves higher on a measure of general role (work, school, 
household) performance. These results, combined with DBT's success at reduc­
ing inpatient psychiatric days, suggest that DBT was somewhat effective at 
improving life interfering behaviors. 
5. DBT's effectiveness at enhancing the behavioral skills targeted was 
mixed. With respect to emotion regulation, DBT subjects, more so than 
treatment-as-usual subjects, tended to rate themselves more successful in 
changing their emotions and improving general emotional control. They also 
had significantly lower scores on self-report measures of trait anger and 
--- Page 43 ---
24 THEORY AND CONCEPTS 
anxious rumination. However, there were no differences between groups in 
self-reported depression even though all subjects improved. With respect to 
interpersonal skills, subjects receiving DBT, compared to those receiving 
treatment-as-usual, rated themselves better on interpersonal effectiveness and 
interpersonal problem-solving, and were higher on both self-report and 
interviewer-rated measures of social adjustment. DBT was not more effec­
tive, relative to the treatment-as-usual condition, in raising subjects' ratings 
of their own success in accepting and tolerating both themselves and reality. 
However, the greater reduction in parasuicidal behavior, inpatient psychiatric 
days, and anger among DBT patients, in spite of no differential improvement 
in depression, hopelessness, suicide ideation, or reasons for living, suggests 
that distress tolerance, at least as manifested by behavioral and emotional 
responses, did improve among those receiving DBT. 
Treatment superiority of DBT was maintained when DBT subjects were 
compared to only those treatment-as-usual subjects who received stable in­
dividual psychotherapy during the treatment year. This suggests that the ef­
fectiveness of DBT is not simply a result of providing individual, stable 
psychotherapy. These results are presented more fully elsewhere (Linehan et 
al., 1991; Linehan & Heard, 1993; Linehan, Tutek, & Heard, 1992). 
We located 37 subjects for 18-month follow-up interviews and 35 for 
24-month follow-ups. (Linehan, Heard, & Armstrong, in press). Many were 
unwilling to complete the entire assessment battery, but were willing to do 
an abbreviated interview covering essential outcome data. The superiority 
of DBT over treatment-as-usual achieved during the treatment year was gener­
ally maintained during the year following treatment. At each follow-up point, 
those receiving DBT were doing better than those in treatment-as-usual on 
measures of global adjustment, social adjustment, and work performance. 
In every area where DBT was superior to treatment-as-usual at posttreatment, 
there was maintenance of DBT gains during follow-up for at least 6 months. 
DBT superiority was stronger during the first 6 months of follow-up for meas­
ures of parasuicidal behavior and anger, and was stronger during the latter 
6 months in reducing psychiatric inpatient days. 
It is important to keep a number of things in mind when considering 
the research bases of DBT's effectiveness. First, although there were very sig­
nificant gains over one year, most of which were maintained over a year of 
follow-up, our data do not support a claim that 1 year of treatment is suffi­
cient for these patients. Our subjects were still scoring in the clinical range 
on almost all measures. Second, one study is a very slim basis for deciding 
that a treatment is effective. Although our outcomes have been replicated by 
Barley et al. (in press), much more research is needed. Third, there are few 
or no data to indicate that other treatments are not effective. With the two 
exceptions I noted above, no other treatments have ever been evaluated in 
a controlled clinical trial.

Study 2 
In the second study (Linehan, Heard, & Armstrong, 1993), we addressed 
the following question: If a borderhne patient is in individual, non-DBT psy­
chotherapy, will treatment effeaiveness be improved if DBT group skills train­
ing is added to the therapy? Eleven subjects were randomly assigned to DBT 
group skills training, and 8 were assigned to a no-skills-training control con­
dition. All subjects were already receiving individual, continuing therapy in 
the community and were referred for group skills training by their individual 
therapists. Subjeas were matched and randomly assigned to conditions. Other 
than their therapy status, there were no significant differences between sub­
jects in this study and those in the first study described above. With the ex­
ception of the fact that we retained subjeas in skills training reasonably well 
over the year (73%), the results suggested that DBT group skills training may 
have little if anything to recommend it as an additive treatment to ongoing 
individual (non-DBT) psychotherapy. At posttreatment, there were no signifi­
cant between-group differences on any variable, nor did means suggest that 
the failure to find such differences was a result of the small sample size. 
We next conduaed a post hoc comparison of all Study 2 patients in stable 
individual psychotherapy («=18) with Study 1 patients who were stable in 
standard DBT (k=21). This allowed us to compare DBT to other individual 
psychotherapy where the therapist was as committed to the patient as in DBT. 
The Study 1 patients getting standard DBT did better in all target areas. Pa­
tients in stable individual treatment-as-usual, whether or not they received 
DBT group skills training, did not do any better (or worse) than the 22 sub­
jeas in Study 1 who were assigned to treatment-as-usual. What can we con­
clude from these findings? First, the second study strengthens the findings 
of the first study: Standard DBT (that is, the psychotherapy plus skills train­
ing) is more effective than general treatment-as-usual. We cannot conclude, 
however, that DBT group skills training is ineffective or unimportant when 
offered within the standard DBT format. Nor is it clear whether DBT skills 
training would be effective if offered alone, without concomitant non-DBT 
individual psychotherapy. In standard DBT, the skills training is integrated 
within individual DBT. The individual therapy provides an enormous amount 
of skills coaching, feedback, and reinforcement. This integration of both types 
of treatment, including the individual help in applying new behavioral skills, 
may be critical to the success of standard DBT. Furthermore, combining non-
DBT individual therapy with DBT skills training might create a conflia for the 
patient that adversely affects outcome. We are currently studying these issues. 
Concluding Comments 
Although there is a fair amount of research on BPD, there is still some con­
troversy about whether the diagnostic entity is usefiil and valid. The prejudice 
--- Page 45 ---
26 THEORY AND CONCEPTS 
against individuals labeled as "borderline" has led many to protest the diag­
nostic label. The term has been associated with so much blaming of the vic­
tims that some believe it should be discarded altogether. Some, pointing to 
the relationship between the diagnoses and childhood sexual abuse (see Chap­
ter 2 for a review of this literature), believe that these individuals should car­
ry a diagnosis that highlights this association, such as "posttraumatic 
syndrome." The idea seems to be that if a label suggests that problem be­
havior is a result of abuse (rather than a fault of the individual), prejudice 
will be reduced. 
Although I am no fan of the term "borderline," I do not believe that we 
will reduce prejudice against these difficult-to-treat individuals by changing 
labels. Instead, I believe that the solution has to be the development of a the­
ory that is based on sound scientific principles, highlighting the basis of the 
disordered "borderline" behaviors in "normal" responses to dysfunctional bi­
ological, psychological, and environmental events. It is by making these in­
dividuals different in principle from ourselves that we can demean them. And 
perhaps, at times, we demean them to make them different. Once we see, 
however, that the principles of behavior influencing normal behavior (including 
our own) are the same principles influencing borderline behavior, we will more 
easily empathize and respond compassionately to the difficulties they present 
us with. The theoretical position described in the next two chapters attempts 
to meet this need. 
NOTES 
1 Psychotherapists usually use either the word "patient" or the word "client" to 
refer to an individual receiving psychotherapy. In this book, I use the term "patient" 
consistently; in the companion skills training manual, I use the term "client." A reason­
able case can be made for using either term. The case for using the term "patient" 
can be found in the first definition of the term (as a noun) given by the Original Ox­
ford English Dictionary on Compact Disc (1987): "A sufferer; one who suffers pa-
tiendy." Although now rare, the definition nonetheless fits perfecdy the borderline 
individuals I see for psychotherapy. The more common meanings of the term— "One 
who is under medical treatment for the cure of some disease or wound," or "A person 
or thing that undergoes some action, or to whom or which something is done" — are 
less applicable, since DBT is not based solely on a disease model, nor does it view 
the patient as passive or one to whom things are done. 
2. It is interesting to note that within both the psychoanalytic and the 
cognitive-behavioral communities, attention to BPD started during the third decade 
of the therapeutic discipline, and for the very same reasons. Treatment techniques that 
are otherwise very effective are less effective when the patient meets criteria for BPD. 
3. Diekstra has been developing a new set of definitions of nonfatal suicidal be­
haviors for inclusion in the 10th revision of the International Classification of Dis­
eases (Diekstra, 1988, cited in Van Egmond & Diekstra, 1989). In this new system, 
attempted suicide is distinguished from parasuicide. The definitions are as follows: 
--- Page 46 ---
The Disorder: Concepts, Controversies, Definitions 27 
Attempted suicide: 
(a) A non-habitual act with non-fatal outcome; 
(b) that is deliberately initiated and performed by the individual involved; 
(c) that causes self-harm or without intervention by others will do so or consists 
of ingesting a substance in excess of its generally recognized therapeutic dosage. 
Parasuicide: 
(a) A non-habitual act with non-fatal outcome; 
(b) that is deliberately initiated and performed by the individual involved in expec­
tation of such an outcome; 
(c) that causes self-harm or without intervention from others will do so or consists 
of ingesting a substance in excess of its generally recognized therapeutic dosage; 
(d) the outcome being considered by the actor as instrumental in bringing about 
desired changes in consciousness and/or social condition" (Van Egmond & Diek­
stra, 1989, p. 53-54).

Dialectical and 
Biosocial Underpinnings 
of Treatment 
Dialectics 
Every theory of personality functioning and of its disorders is based on some 
fundamental world view. Often this world view is left unspoken, and one 
has to read between the lines to figure it out. For example, Rogers's client-
centered theory and therapy are based on the assumptions that people are 
fundamentally good and that they have an innate drive toward self-
aaualization. Freud assumed that individuals seek pleasure and avoid pain. 
He further assumed that all behavior is psychologically determined, and that 
there is no accidental behavior (behavior determined by accidental events of 
one's environment). 
Similarly, DBT is based on a specific world view, that of dialeaics. In 
this section, I provide an overview of what I mean by "dialeaics." I hope to 
show you that understanding this point of view is important and can enhance 
the ways of thinking about and interacting with borderline patients. I am not 
going to give a philosophical leaure on the meaning and history of the term, 
nor an in-depth coverage of current philosophical thinking in this area. Suffice 
it to say that dialeaics is alive and well. Most people are aware of dialectics 
through the socioeconomic theory of Marx and Engels (1970). As a world 
view, however, dialeaics also figures in theories of the development of science 
(Kuhn, 1970), biological evolution (Levins & Lewontin, 1985), sexual rela­
tions (Firestone, 1970), and more recently the development of thinking in 
adults (Basseches, 1984). Wells (1972, cited in Kegan, 1982) has documented 
a shift toward dialeaical approaches in almost every social and natural science 
during the last 150 years.

Dialectical and Biosocial Underpinnings of Treatment 29 
Why Dialectics? 
The application of dialectics to my treatment approach began in the early 
1980s with a series of therapy observations and discussions by my clinical 
research team. The team observed me in weekly therapy sessions while I at­
tempted to apply to parasuicidal patients the cognitive-behavioral therapy 
I had learned at the State University of New York at Stony Brook under Gerald 
Davison and Marvin Goldfried. After each session, we would discuss both 
my behavior and that of the patient. At that time, the aims were to identify 
helpful techniques or, at a minimum, those that did not hamper therapeutic 
change and a positive working relationship. I was then to try to apply them 
in a consistent manner in future sessions. Subsequent discussions were aimed 
at keeping what was useful, discarding what was not, and developing be­
haviorally anchored descriptions of what exaaly I as the therapist was doing. 
A number of things happened during the course of treatment develop­
ment. First, we verified that I could apply cognitive-behavioral therapy with 
this population; that was reassuring, since that was the primary intent of the 
projea. However, as we observed what I was doing, it seemed that I was also 
applying a number of other procedures not traditionally associated with cog­
nitive or behavior therapy. These techniques were things such as matter-of-
fact exaggerations of the implications of events, similar to Whitaker's (1975, 
pp. 12-13); encouraging the acceptance rather than change of feelings and 
situations, in the tradition of Zen Buddhism (e.g.. Watts, 1961); and double-
bind statements such as those of the Bateson projea direaed at pathological 
behavior (Watzlawick, 1978). These techniques are more closely aligned with 
paradoxical therapy approaches than with standard cognitive and behavioral 
therapy. In addition, the pace of therapy seemed to include rapid changes in 
verbal style between, on the one hand, warm acceptance and empathetic reflec­
tion reminiscent of client-centered therapy, and, on the other hand, blunt, 
irreverent, confrontational comments. Movement and timing seemed as im­
portant as context and technique. 
Although a colleague and I subsequently developed the relationship be­
tween DBT and paradoxical treatment strategies (Shearin & Linehan, 1989), 
when I was originally explicating the treatment I was reluaant to identify 
the approach with paradoxical procedures, because I was afraid that inex­
perienced therapists might overgeneralize from the "paradoxical" label and 
prescribe suicidal behavior itself; this was and is explicitly not done in the 
therapy. But I needed a label for the therapy. Clearly, it was not only stan­
dard cognitive-behavioral therapy. The emphasis at that time in cognitive ther­
apy on rationality as the criterion of healthy thought seemed incompatible 
with my attention to intuitive and nonrational thought as equally advanta­
geous. I was also becoming convinced that the problems of these patients did 
not result primarily from cognitive distortions of themselves and their en­
vironment, even though distortions seemed to play an important role in main­
taining problems once they began. My focus in much of treatment on accepting 
--- Page 49 ---
30 THEORY AND CONCEPTS 
painful emotional states and problematic environmental events seemed differ­
ent from the usual cognitive-behavioral approach of trying to change or mod­
ify painful emotional states or act on environments to change them. 
I began to think of "dialectical" as a descriptor of the therapy because 
of my intuitive experience in conduaing therapy with this population of se­
verely disturbed, chronically suicidal patients. The experience can best be 
described in terms of an image. It is as if the patient and I are on opposite 
ends of a teeter-totter; we are conneaed to each other by the board of the 
teeter-totter. Therapy is the process of going up and down, each of us sliding 
back and forth on the teeter-totter, trying to balance it so that we can get 
to the middle together and climb up to a higher level, so to speak. This higher 
level, representing growT:h and development, can be thought of as a synthesis 
of the preceding level. Then the process begins again. We are on a new teeter-
totter trying to get to the middle in an effort to move to the next level, and 
so on. In the process, as the patient is continually moving back and forth 
on the teeter-totter, from the end toward the middle and from the middle back 
toward the end, I move also, trying to maintain a balance. 
The difficulty in treating a suicidal borderline patient is that instead of 
on a teeter-totter, we are aaually balanced on a bamboo pole perched precar­
iously on a high wire stretched over the Grand Canyon. Thus, when the pa­
tient moves backward on the pole, if I move backward to gain balance, and 
then the patient moves backward again to regain balance, and so forth, we 
are in danger of falling into the canyon. (The pole is not infinitely long.) Thus, 
it seems that my task as the therapist is not only to maintain the balance, 
but to maintain it in such a way that both of us move to the middle rather 
than back off the ends of the pole. Very rapid movement and countermove-
ment of the therapist seem to constitute a central part of the treatment. 
The tensions that I experienced during therapy; the need to move to 
balance or synthesis with this patient population; and the treatment strate­
gies reminiscent of paradoxical techniques that seemed a necessary adjunct 
to standard behavioral techniques —all these led me to the study of dialecti­
cal philosophy as a possible organizing theory or point of view.* Dialecti-
cally speaking, the ends of the teeter-totter represent the opposites ("thesis" 
and "antithesis"); moving to the middle and up to the next level of the teeter-
totter represents the integration or "synthesis" of these opposites, which im­
mediately dissolves into opposites once again. This psychotherapeutic rela­
tionship between the opposites embodied in the term "dialectics" has been 
regularly pointed out since the early writings of Freud (Seltzer, 1986). 
However serendipitous the original choice of a label was, the movement 
to a dialectical view subsequendy guided the therapy development in a much 
broader fashion than would have been possible with just a paradoxical twist 
to techniques. Consequently, the treatment has evolved into its form of the 
past few years as an interaction between therapy process and dialectical theory. 
Over time, the term "dialectics" as applied to behavior therapy has come to 
imply two contexts of usage: that of the fundamental nature of reality and 
--- Page 50 ---
Dialectical and Biosocial Underpinnings of Treatment 31 
that of persuasive dialogue and relationship. As a world view or philosophi­
cal position, dialectics forms the basis of the therapeutic approach presented 
in this book. Alternatively, as a form of dialogue and relationship, dialeaics 
refers to the treatment approach or strategies used by the therapist to effect 
change. Thus, central to DBT are a number of therapeutic dialeaical strate­
gies; these are described in Chapter 8. 
Dialectical World View 
A dialeaical perspeaive on the nature of reality and human behavior has three 
primary charaaeristics. 
The Principle of Interrelatedness and Wholeness 
First, dialectics stresses interrelatedness and wholeness. Dialectics assumes 
a systems perspective on reality. The analysis of parts of a system is of lim­
ited value unless the analysis dearly relates the part to the whole. Thus, identity 
itself is relational, and boundaries between parts are temporary and exist only 
in relation to the whole; indeed, it is the whole that determines the bound­
aries. Levins and Lewontin (1985) state this well: 
Parts and wholes evolve in consequence of their relationship, and the relation­
ship itself evolves. These are the properties of things that we call dialectical: that 
one thing cannot exist without the other, that one acquires its properties from 
its relation to the other, that the properties of both evolve as a consequence of 
their interpretation, (p. 3) 
This holistic view is compatible with both feminist and contextual views 
of psychopathology. Such a perspective, when applied to treatment of BPD 
made me question the importance given to separation, differentiation, individ­
uation, and independence in Western cultural thought. Notions of the in­
dividual as unitary and separate have only gradually emerged over the last 
several hundred years (Baumeister, 1987; Sampson, 1988). Since women receive 
the diagnosis of BPD much more frequently than men, the influence of gender 
on notions of self and appropriate interpersonal boundaries is of particular 
interest in our thinking about the disorder. 
Both gender and social class significantly influence how one defines and 
experiences the self. Women, as well as other individuals vdth less social power, 
are more likely to have a relational or social self (a self that includes the group) 
as opposed to an individuated self (one that excludes the group) (McGuire 
& McGuire, 1982; Pratt, Pancer, Hunsberger, & Manchester, 1990). The im­
portance of a relational or social self among women has been highlighted 
by many feminist writers, the best-known of whom is Gilligan (1982). Lykes 
(1985) has perhaps argued the feminist position most cogently in defining 
"the self as an ensemble of social relations" (p. 364). It is very important to 
note that Lykes and others do not speak simply of the value of interdepen-
--- Page 51 ---
32 THEORY AND CONCEPTS 
dence among autonomous selves. Rather, they describe a social or relational 
self that is itself "a coacting network of relationships embedded in an intri­
cate system of social exchanges and obligations" (Lykes, 1985, p. 362). When 
the self is defined as "in relation," inclusive of others in its very definition, 
no fully separate self exists—that is, no self separated from the whole. Such 
a relational self, or "ensembled individualism" in Sampson's terms, charac­
terizes the majority of societies, both historically and cross-culturally (Samp­
son, 1988). 
Attention to these contextual faaors is particularly essential when a cul­
tural construct such as "self is employed to explain and describe another 
cultural construct such as "mental health." While the traditional definition 
of self may generally prove adaptive for some individuals in Western society, 
one must consider that our definitions and theories are not universal but are 
products of Western society, and thus may prove inappropriate for many in­
dividuals. As Heidi Heard and 1 have argued elsewhere (Heard & Linehan, 
1993), and as I discuss later in this chapter and in Chapter 3, the problems 
encountered by the borderline individual may result in part from the colli­
sion of a relational self with a society that recognizes and rewards only the 
individuated self. 
The Principle of Polarity 
Second, reality is not statirc, but is comprised of intemal opposing forces ("the­
sis" and "antithesis"), out of whose integration ("synthesis") evolves a new 
set of opposing forces. Although dialectics focuses on the whole, it also em­
phasizes the complexity of any whole. Thus, within each one thing or sys­
tem, no matter how small, there is polarity. In physics, for example, no matter 
how hard physicists try to find the single particle or element that is the basis 
of all existence, they always end up with an element that can be further 
reduced. In the single atom there is a negative and a positive charge; for each 
force, there is a counterforce; even the smallest element of matter is balanced 
by anti-matter. 
A very important dialectical idea is that all propositions contain within 
them their own oppositions. Or, as Goldberg (1980) put it, 
I assume that truth is paradoxical, that each article of wisdom contains within 
it its own contradictions, that truths stand side by side. Contradictory truths do 
not necessarily cancel each other out or dominate each other, but stand side by 
side, inviting participation and experimentation, (pp. 295-296) 
If you take this idea seriously, it can have a rather profound impact on your 
clinical praaice. For example, in most descriptions of BPD, the emphasis is 
on identifying the pathology that sets the individual apart from others. Treat­
ment is then designed to ferret out the pathology and create conditions for 
change. A dialectical perspective, however, suggests that within dysfunction 
there is also function; that within distortion there is accuracy; and that with-
--- Page 52 ---
Dialectical and Biosocial Underpinnings of Treatment 33 
in destruction one can find construction. It was turning this idea around — 
"contradictions within wisdom" to "wisdom within contradictions"—that led 
me to a number of decisions about the form of DBT. Instead of searching 
for the validity of the patient's current behavior in the leaming of the past, 
I began to search for and find it in the current moment. Thus, the idea took 
me a step beyond simply empathizing with the patient. Validation is now a 
crucial part of DBT. 
The same idea led me to the construa of "wise mind," which is a focus 
on the inherent wisdom of patients. DBT assumes that each individual is cap­
able of wisdom with respect to her own life, although this capability is not 
always obvious or even accessible. Thus, the DBT therapist trusts that the 
patient has within herself all of the potential that is necessary for change. 
The essential elements for growth are already present in the current situa­
tion. The acorn is the tree. Within the DBT case consultation team, the idea 
led to the emphases on finding the value in each person's point of view, rather 
than defending the value of one's own position. 
Thesis, Antithesis, Synthesis: 
The Principle of Continuous Change 
Finally, the interconnected, oppositional, and nonreducible nature of reality 
leads to a wholeness continually in the process of change. It is the tension 
between the thesis and antithesis forces within each system (positive and nega­
tive, good and bad, children and parents, patient and therapist, person and 
environment, etc.) that produces change. The new state following change (the 
synthesis), however, is also comprised of polar forces; and, thus, change is 
continuous. The principle of dialeaical change is important to keep in mind, 
even though I use these terms ("thesis," "antithesis," "synthesis") rarely. 
Change, then (or "process," if you will), rather than structure or con­
tent, is the essential nature of life. Robert Kegan (1982) captures this point 
of view in his description of the evolution of self as a process of transforma­
tions over one's lifespan, generated by tensions between self-preservation and 
self-transformation within the person and within the person-environment sys­
tem punauated by temporary truces or developmental balances. He writes: 
As it is to understand the way the person creates the world, we must also under­
stand the way the world creates the person. In considering where a person is 
in his or her evolutionary balancing we are looking not only at how meaning 
is made; we are looking too, at the possibility of the person losing this balance. 
We are looking, in each balance, at a new sense of what is ultimate and what 
is ultimately at stake. We are looking, in each new balance, at a new vulnerabili­
ty. Each balance suggests how the person is composed, but each suggests, too, 
a new way for the person to lose her composure, (p. 114) 
A dialeaical point of view is quite compatible with psychodynamic the­
ory, which stresses the inherent role of conflict and opposition in the process 
--- Page 53 ---
34 THEORY AND CONCEPTS 
of growth and change. It is also compatible with a behavioral perspective 
which stresses the inherent wholeness of the environment and individual, and 
the interrelatedness of each in producing change. Dialectics as a theory of 
change is somewhat different from the self-aaualizing notion of development 
assumed by client-centered therapy. In that perspeaive, each thing has with­
in it a potentiality that will unfold naturally throughout its lifetime. "Unfold­
ing" does not imply the tension inherent in dialectical grovrth. It is this tension 
that produces gradual change, punctuated by spurts of sudden shifts and dra­
matic movement. 
In DBT, the therapist channels change in the patient, while at the same 
time recognizing that the change engendered is also transforming the therapy 
and the therapist. Thus, there is an ever-present dialeaical tension within ther­
apy itself between the process of change and the outcome of change. At each 
moment, there is a temporary balance between the patient's attempts to main­
tain herself as she is without changing, and her attempts to change herself 
regardless of the constraints of her history and current situation. The transi­
tion to each new temporary stability is often experienced as a painful crisis. 
"Any real resolution of the crisis must ultimately involve a new way of being 
in the world. Yet the resistance to doing so is great, and will not occur in 
the absence of repeated and varied encounters in natural experience" (Kegan, 
1982, p. 41). The therapist helps the patient resolve crises by supporting simul­
taneously her attempts at self-preservation and at self-transformation. Con­
trol and direction channel the patient toward increased self-control and 
self-direction. Nurturing stands side by side with teaching the patient to care 
for herself. 
Dialectical Persuasion 
From the point of view of dialogue and relationship, "dialectics" refers to 
change by persuasion and by making use of the oppositions inherent in the 
therapeutic relationship, rather than by formal impersonal logic. Thus, un­
like analytical thinking, dialeaics is personal, taking into account and af-
feaing the total person. It is an approach to engaging a person in dialogue 
so that movement can be made. Through the therapeutic opposition of con­
tradictory positions, both patient and therapist can arrive at new meanings 
within old meanings, moving closer to the essence of the subject under con­
sideration. 
As noted above, the synthesis in a dialectic contains elements of both 
the thesis and antithesis, so that neither of the original positions can be regard­
ed as "absolutely true." The synthesis, however, always suggests a new an­
tithesis and thus acts as a new thesis. Truth, therefore, is neither absolute 
nor relative; rather, it evolves, develops, and is constructed over time. From 
the dialectical perspeaive, nothing is self-evident, and nothing stands apart 
from anything else as unrelated knowledge. The spfrit of a dialectical point 
of view is never to accept a final truth or an undisputable fact. Thus, the 
--- Page 54 ---
Dialectical and Biosocial Underpinnings of Treatment 35 
question addressed by both patient and therapist is "What is being left out 
of our understanding?" 
I do not mean to imply that a sentence such as "It is raining and it is 
not raining" embodies a dialectic. Nor am I suggesting that a statement can­
not be wrong, or not faaual in a particular context. False dichotomies and 
false dialectics can occur. However, in these cases the thesis and/or antithesis 
has been misidentified, and thus one does not have a genuine antagonism. 
For example, a common statement during the Viemam War, "Love it or leave 
it," was a classic case of a misidentification of the dialeaic. 
As I discuss in Chapters 4 and 13, dialectical dialogue is also very im­
portant in therapy team meetings. Perhaps more than any other faaor, atten­
tion to dialectics can reduce the chances of staff splitting in treating borderline 
patients. Splitting among staff members almost always results from a conclu­
sion by one or more factions within the staff that they (and sometimes they 
alone) have a "lock" on the truth about a particular patient or clinical problem. 
Borderline Personality Disorder as Dialectical Failure 
In some ways, borderline behaviors can be viewed as results of dialectical 
failures. 
Borderline "Splitting" 
As discussed in Chapter 1, borderline and suicidal individuals frequently vacil­
late between rigidly held yet contradiaory points of view, and are unable to 
move forward to a synthesis of the two positions. They tend to see reality 
in polarized categories of "either-or," rather than "all," and within a very fixed 
frame of reference. For example, it is not uncommon for a such individuals 
to believe that the smallest fault makes it impossible for a person to be "good" 
inside. Their rigid cognitive style further limits their ability to entertain ideas 
of future change and ttansition, resulting in feelings of being in an interminable 
painful situation. Things once defined do not change. Once a person is 
"flawed," for instance, that person will remain flawed forever. 
Such thinking among borderline individuals has been labeled "splitting" 
by psychoanalysts, and it forms an important part of psychoanalytic theory 
on BPD (Kemberg, 1984). Dichotomous thinking or splitting can be viewed 
as the tendency to get stuck in either the thesis or the antithesis, unable to 
move toward synthesis. An inability to believe that both a proposition (e.g., 
"I want to live") and its opposite ("I want to die") can be simultaneously true 
charaaerizes the suicidal and borderline individual. Splitting, from a psy­
chodynamic point of view, is a product of the irresolvable conflia between 
intense negative and positive emotions. 
From the dialeaical perspeaive, however, conflia that is maintained is 
a dialectical failure. Instead of synthesis and transcendence, in the conflict 
--- Page 55 ---
36 THEORY AND CONCEPTS 
typical of borderline individuals there is opposition between firmly rooted 
but contradictory positions, wishes, points of view, and so on. The resolu­
tion of conflict requires first the recognition of the polarities and then the 
ability to rise above them, so to speak, seeing the apparently paradoxical reality 
of both and neither. At the level of synthesis and integration that occurs when 
polarity is transcended, the seeming paradox resolves itself. 
Difficulties with Self and Identity 
Borderline individuals are frequently confused about their own identity, and 
tend to scan the environment for guidelines on how to be and what to think 
and feel. Such confusion can arise from a failure to experience their essential 
relatedness with other people, as well as the relationship of this moment to 
other moments in time. They are forever on the edge of the abyss, so to speak. 
Without these relational experiences, identity becomes defined in terms of 
each current moment and interaction experienced in isolation, and thus is 
variable and unprediaable rather than stable. In addition, there is no other 
moment in time to modulate the impact of the current moment. For a bor­
derline patient, another person's anger at her in a particular interaaion is 
not buffered by either other relationships where people are not angry or other 
points in time when this person is not angry at her. "You are angry at me" 
becomes infinite reality. The part becomes the whole. A number of other the­
orists have pointed out the important role of memory for affeaive events 
(Lumsden, 1991), especially interpersonal events (Adler, 1985), in the develop­
ment and maintenance of BPD. Mark Williams (1991) has made a similar 
argument with respect to failures in autobiographical memory. Clearly, prior 
events and relationships must be available to memory if they are to buffer 
and be integrated within the present. 
Interpersonal Isolation and Alienation 
The dialeaical perspective on unity presupposes that individuals are not 
separate from their environment. Isolation, alienation, feelings of being out 
of contact or not fitting in—all characteristic feelings of borderline 
individuals —are dialeaical failures coming from the individuals setting up 
of a self-other opposition. Such an opposition can occur even in the absence 
of an adequate sense of self-identity. Often among borderline individuals, a 
sense of unity and integration is sought by suppression and/or nondevelop-
ment of self-identity (beliefs, likes, desires, attitudes, independent skills, etc.), 
rather than by the dialectical strategy of synthesis and transcendence. The 
paradox that one can be different but at the same time part of the whole is 
not grasped. The opposition between person (part) and environment (whole) 
is maintained.

Case Conceptualization: 
A Dialectical Cognitive-Behavioral Approach 
Case conceptualization in DBT is guided both by dialectics and by the as­
sumptions of cognitive-behavioral theory. In this seaion, I review several 
characteristics of cognitive-behavioral theory that are important to DBT; I 
also suggest how a dialeaical cognitive-behavioral approach differs some­
what from more traditional cognitive, behavioral, and biological theories. 
More specific theoretical points are reviewed as they relate to the specific DBT 
intervention strategies. 
The Definition of "Behavior" 
"Behavior," as used by cognitive-behavioral therapists, is a very broad term. 
It includes any activity, funaioning, or reaaion of the person—that is, "any­
thing that an organism does involving aaion and response to stimulation" 
[Merriam-Webster Dictionary, 1977, p. 100). Physicists are using the term 
similarly when they speak of the behavior of a molecule; likewise systems 
analysts speak of the behavior of a system. Human behavior can be overt, 
(i.e., public and observable to others) or covert (i.e., private and observable 
only to the person behaving). In tum, covert behaviors may occur inside the 
person's body (e.g., stomach muscles tightening) or outside the body but 
nonetheless private, (e.g., behavior when a person is alone).^ 
The Three Modes of Behavior 
Contemporary cognitive-behavioral therapists typically categorize behavior 
into one of three modes: motoric, cognitive-verbal, and physiological. Motor 
behaviors are what most people think of as behavior; they include overt and 
covert actions and movements of the skeletal muscular system. 
Cognitive-verbal behavior includes such aaivities as thinking, problem solv­
ing, perceiving, imaging, speaking, writing, and gestural communication, as 
well as observational behavior (e.g., attending, orienting, recalling, and review­
ing). Physiological behaviors include aaivities of the nervous system, glands, 
and smooth muscles. Although usually covert (e.g., heartbeat), physiological 
behaviors can also be overt (e.g., blushing and crying). 
A number of things are important to note here. First, dividing behaviors 
into categories or modes is intrinsically arbitrary and is done for the con­
venience of the observer. Human funaioning is continuous, and any response 
involves the total human system. Even partially independent behavioral sub­
systems share neural circuits and interconneaing neural pathways. However, 
behavioral systems that in nature do not occur separately are nonetheless often 
distinguished conceptually, because the distinction provides some increase in 
our ability to analyze the processes in question. 
--- Page 57 ---
38 THEORY AND CONCEPTS 
Emotions as Full-System Responses^ 
Emotions, from the present perspective, are integrated responses of the total 
system. Generally, the form of the integration is automatic, either because 
of biological hard-wiring (the basic emotions) or because of repeated ex­
periences (learned emotions). That is, an emotion typically comprises be­
haviors from each of the three subsystems. For example, basic researchers 
define emotions as comprised of phenomenological experience (cognitive sys­
tem), biochemical changes (physiological system), and expressive and aaion 
tendencies (physiological plus motor systems). Complex emotions might also 
include one or more appraisal aaivities (cognitive system). Emotions, in tum, 
usually have important consequences for subsequent cognitive, physiologi­
cal, and motor behavior. Thus, emotions not only are full-system behavioral 
responses, but themselves affect the full system. The complex, systemic na­
ture of emotions makes it unlikely that any unique precursor of emotion dys­
regulation, either in general or with particular respect to BPD, will be found. 
There are many roads to Rome. 
Intrinsic Equality of Behavioral Modes 
as Causes of Functioning 
In contrast to biological psychiatry and cognitive psychology, the position 
taken here is that no mode of behavior is intrinsically more important than 
the others as a cause of human functioning. Thus, in contrast to cognitive 
theories (e.g.. Beck, 1976, Beck et al., 1973, 1990), DBT does not view be­
havioral dysfunction, including emotion dysregulation, as necessarily result­
ing from dysfunctional cognitive processes. This is not to say that under some 
conditions cognitive activities do not influence motor and physiological be­
haviors, as well as the activation of emotional behaviors; in fact, a wealth 
of data suggests that the opposite is the case. Close to the topic of this book, 
for example, are the repeated findings of Aaron Beck and his colleagues (Beck, 
Brown, & Steer, 1989; Beck, Steer, Kovacs, & Garrison, 1985) that hopeless 
expectations about the future predict subsequent suicidal behaviors. 
Moreover, in contrast to biological psychology and psychiatry, DBT does 
not view neurophysiological dysfunctions as intrinsically more important in­
fluences on behavior than other avenues of influence. Thus, from my per­
speaive, although behavior-behavior or response system-response system 
relationships and causal pathways are important in human functioning, they 
are not more influential than any other pathways. The crucial question be­
comes this: Under what conditions does one behavior or behavioral pattern 
occur and influence another (Hayes, Kohlenberg, &c Melancon, 1989)? Ulti­
mately, however, from a dialectical framework, simple linear causal patterns 
of behavioral influence are not sought. Rather, the important question is more 
like that suggested by Manicas and Secord (1983): What is the nature of a 
given organism or process under prevailing circumstances? From this perspec­
tive, events, including behavioral events, are always the outcome of complex 
causal configurations at the same and at many different levels.

The Individual-Environment System: 
A Transactional Mode 
A number of etiological models of psychopathology have been offered in the 
literature. Most current theories are based on some version of an interaction 
model, in which characteristics of the individual interact with charaaeristics 
of the environment to produce an effea—in this case, psychological disorder. 
The "diathesis-stress model" is by far the most general and ubiquitous inter­
active model. This model suggests that a psychological disorder is the result 
of a disorder-specific predisposition toward disease (the diathesis), which is 
expressed under conditions of general or specific environmental stress. The 
term "diathesis" generally refers to a constitutional or biological predisposi­
tion, but more modern usage includes any individual charaaeristic that in­
creases a person's chance of developing a disorder. Given a certain amount 
of stress (i.e., noxious or unpleasant environmental stimuli), the individual 
develops the diathesis-linked disorder. The person is not equipped to cope 
with such stress, and thus behavioral funaioning disintegrates. 
In contrast, a dialeaical or transactional model assumes that individual 
funaioning and environmental conditions are mutually and continuously in-
teraaive, reciprocal, and interdependent. Within social learning theory, this 
is the principle of "reciprocal determinism": The environment and the individu­
al adapt to and influence each other. Although the individual is surely affeaed 
by the environment, the environment is also affected by the individual. It is 
conceptually convenient to distinguish the environment from the individual 
person, but in reality they cannot be distinguished. The individual-environ­
ment is a whole system, defined by and defining the constituent parts. Be­
cause influence is reciprocal, it is transaaional rather than interactional. 
Chess and Thomas (1986) have written extensively about this pattern 
of reciprocal influence with respea to the effeas of different temperamental 
charaaeristics of children on their family environments, and vice versa. Their 
notion of "poorness of fit" as an important faaor in the etiology of psycho­
logical dysfunaion has heavily influenced the theory proposed here. I dis­
cuss these ideas more fully later in the chapter. 
Besides focusing on reciprocal influence, a transaaional view also high­
lights the constant state of flux and change of the individual-environment 
system. Thomas and Chess (1985) have labeled such a model "homeodynam-
ic," in contrast to interaaive models that conceptualize the end state of in­
dividuals and environments as some sort of "homeostatic" equilibrium. A 
homeodynamic model is also dialeaical. They quote from Sameroff (1975, 
p. 290), who makes this point very well: 
[The interactive model] is insufficient to facilitate our understanding of the ac­
tual mechanisms leading to later outcomes. The major reason behind the inade­
quacy of this model is that neither constitution nor environment are necessarily 
constant over time. At each moment, month, or year the charaaeristics of both 
the child and his [sic] environment change in important ways. Moreover, these 
differences are interdependent and change as a function of their mutual influence 
on one another. 
--- Page 59 ---
40 THEORY AND CONCEPTS 
Millon (1987a) has made much the same point in discussing the etiology of 
BPD and the futility of attempting to locate the "cause" of the disorder in 
any single event or time period. 
A transaaional model highlights a number of points that are easy to over­
look in a diathesis-stress model. For example, people in a particular environ­
ment may aa in a manner that is stressful to an individual in it only because 
the environment itself was exposed to the stress that this individual placed 
on it. Examples of such individuals include the child who, due to sickness, 
requires expenditure of much of the family's financial resources, or the psy­
chiatric patient who uses up much of the inpatient nursing resources because 
of the need for constant suicide precautions. Both of these individuals' en­
vironments are stretched in their ability to respond well to further stress; other 
people in both environments may invalidate or temporarily blame the viaim 
if any further demand on the system is made. Although the system (e.g., the 
child's family) may have been predisposed to respond dysfunctionally in any 
case, it may have avoided such responses if it had not been exposed to the 
stress of that particular individual. 
A transactional model does not assume necessarily equal power of in­
fluence on both sides of the equation. For example, some genetic influences 
can be powerful enough to overwhelm a benign or even a healing environ­
ment. Current research suggests a much greater influence of genetic heritage 
on even normal adult personality charaaeristics than was previously believed 
(Scarr & McCartney, 1983; Tellegen et al., 1988). Nor can we discount the 
influence of a powerful situation on the behavior of most individuals exposed 
to the situation, despite large, pre-existing individual personality differences 
(Milgram, 1963, 1964). Any person, no matter how hardy, who is exposed 
repeatedly to violent sexual or physical abuse will be harmed. 
A Visual Representation 
of an Environment-Person System 
A visual representation of an environment-person system is shown in Figure 
2.1. I developed the particular model shown here a number of years ago to 
capture the data on suicidal and parasuicidal behavior. To the left is a box 
representing the environmental subsystem. Although in this scheme the en­
vironment is represented as four-cornered, this is done only for theoretical 
purposes relevant to suicidal behavior. Depending on the particular environ­
mental factors believed to be important in an event or behavior pattern un­
der study, one could represent the environment with as many sides as there 
are factors in the theory. 
The person is subdivided into two separate subsystems. The behavioral 
subsystem is a triangle representing the three modes of behavior described 
above. The circular arrows at each point of the triangle indicate that responses 
within each behavioral mode are self-regulatory, in that changes in one 
response effect changes in another. Interestingly, although this aspect of be­
havior is well studied for physiological responses, corresponding attention

response modes self-regulate. 
The second triangle represents stable, organismic characteristics of the 
person that are not typically influenced by either the individual's behavior 
or the environment. These stable characteristics can, however, have impor­
tant influences on both the environment and the behavior of the individual. 
In the model represented here, the triangular points represent gender, race, 
and age. As with the environmental square, however, these points are simply 
conceptually convenient. Gender, race, and age are related in important ways 
to suicidal behaviors. Other disorders will require representation of different 
organismic variables. For example, in the study of schizophrenia, one might 
want an organismic point representing genetic makeup.

42 THEORY AND CONCEPTS 
Biosocial Theory: A Dialectical Theory of 
Borderline Personality Disorder Development 
Overview 
DBT is based on a biosocial theory of personality functioning. The major 
premise is that BPD is primarily a dysfunction of the emotion regulation sys­
tem; it results from biological irregularities combined with certain dysfunc­
tional environments, as well as from their interaction and transaction over 
time. The charaaeristics associated with BPD (see Chapter 1, especially Tables 
1.2 and 1.5) are sequelae of, and thus secondary to, this fundamental emo­
tion dysregulation. Moreover, these same patterns cause further deregulation. 
Invalidating environments during childhood contribute to the development 
of emotion dysregulation; they also fail to teach the child how to label and 
regulate arousal, how to tolerate emotional distress, and when to trust her 
own emotional responses as reflections of valid interpretations of events. 
As adults, borderline individuals adopt the charaaeristics of the invalidat­
ing environment. Thus, they tend to invalidate their own emotional ex­
periences, look to others for accurate reflections of external reality, and 
oversimplify the ease of solving life's problems. This oversimplification leads 
inevitably to unrealistic goals, an inability to use reward instead of punish­
ment for small steps toward final goals, and self-hate following failure to 
achieve these goals. The shame reaction —a characteristic response to uncon­
trollable and negative emotions among borderline individuals — is a natural 
result of a social environment that "shames" those who express emotional 
vulnerability. 
As noted in Chapter 1 in a slightly different context, the formulation 
proposed here is simUar to that of Grotstein et al. (1987), who have proposed 
that BPD is a disorder of self-regulation. By this they mean that the disorder 
represents a primary breakdown of the regulation of states of self, such as 
arousal, attention, sleep, wakefulness, self-esteem, affeas, and needs, together 
with the secondary sequelae of such a breakdown. As Grotstein et al. have 
noted, few theories of BPD have integrated biological and psychological fac­
tors into a coherent theory. To date, most theories have been either squarely 
psychological, whether psychoanalytic (e.g., Adler, 1985; Masterson, 1972, 
1976; Kernberg, 1975, 1976; Rinsley, 1980a, 1980b; Meissner, 1984) or 
cognitive-behavioral (e.g.. Beck et al., 1990; Young, 1987; Pretzer, in press); 
or they have been products of biological psychiatry (e.g., Klein, 1977; Cow­
dry & Gardner, 1988; Akiskal, 1981, 1983; Wender & Klein, 1981). Grot-
stein's (1987) formulation is a wedding of biological psychiatry and 
psychoanalytically informed psychological theory. Stone (1987) has suggested 
a similar integration. He nicely describes the difficulty of becoming well versed 
in the two broad areas of psychology and biology and integrating them into 
a theoretical position on BPD as approximating "in complexity the task of 
translating a text composed, perversely, of Arabic words alternating with 
Chinese" (pp. 253-254). 
--- Page 62 ---
Dialectical and Biosocial Underpinnings of Treatment 43 
The biosocial formulation presented here is based primarily on the ex­
perimental literature in psychology. What I have found in perusing this litera­
ture is that there is a wealth of basic empirical data on such diverse topics 
as personality and behavioral functioning, genetic and physiological bases 
of behavior and personality, temperament, basic emotional funaioning, and 
environmental effeas on behavior; however, with only a few exceptions (e.g., 
Costa and McCrae, 1986), there has been little attempt to apply this basic 
research literature in psychology to the understanding of personality disord­
ers. This state of affairs probably exists because, until very recently, the em­
pirical study of personahty disorders has been done primarily by psychiatrists, 
whereas the empirical study of behavior per se (including the study of bio­
logical bases of behavior) has been the domain of psychologists. The gulf 
between these two fields has been large, with members of neither reading much 
of the literature in the other. Empirically based clinical psychology, which 
one could consider the natural bridge between the two disciplines, has until 
recently shown little or no interest in personality disorders. 
Borderline Personality Disorder and Emotion Dysregulation 
As I stated above, the biosocial theory is that BPD is primarily a disorder 
of the emotion regulation system. Emotion dysregulation, in tum, is due to 
high emotional vulnerability plus an inability to regulate emotions.'' The 
more emotionally vulnerable the individual is, the greater the need for emo­
tion modulation. The thesis here is that borderline individuals are emotion­
ally vulnerable as well as deficient in emotion modulation skills, and that 
these difficulties have their roots in biological predispositions, which are ex­
acerbated by specific environmental experiences. 
The premise of excessive emotional vulnerability fits empirical descrip­
tions, developed in entirely separate research traditions, of both parasuicidal 
and borderhne populations. I have reviewed this literature in Chapter 1. In 
summary, the emotional picture of both parasuicidal and borderline individu­
als is one of chronic, aversive affeaive experiences. Failures to inhibit maladap­
tive, mood-dependent aaions are by definition part of the borderline 
syndrome. Discussions of affect dysregulation with respea to BPD usually 
concentrate on the depression-mania continuum (e.g., Gunderson & Zanar­
ini, 1989). In contrast, I am using "affect" here in a much more global sense, 
and suggest that borderline individuals have regulation difficulties across sever­
al (if not all) emotional response systems. Although it is likely that emotion 
dysregulation is most pronounced in negative emotions, borderline individu­
als also seem to have difficulty regulating positive emotions and their sequelae. 
Ennotional Vulnerability 
Charaaeristics of emotional vulnerability include high sensitivity to emotional 
stimuli, emotional intensity, and slow return to emotional baseline. "High 
--- Page 63 ---
44 THEORY AND CONCEPTS 
sensitivity" means that the individual reacts quickly and has a low threshold 
for an emotional reaction; that is, it does not take much to provoke an emo­
tional reaaion. Events that might not bother many people are likely to bother 
the emotionally vulnerable person. The sensitive child reacts emotionally to 
even slight frustration or disapproval. At the adult level, the therapist's leav­
ing town for the weekend may elicit an emotional response from the border­
line patient, but not from most other patients. The implications for 
psychotherapy are, I suspect, obvious. The feeling, noted frequently by ther­
apists and families of borderline individuals, of having to "walk on eggs'' is 
a result of this sensitivity. 
"Emotional intensity" means that emotional reaaions are extreme. Emo­
tionally intense individuals are the dramatic people of the world. On the nega­
tive side, partings may precipitate very intense and painful grief; what would 
cause slight embarrassment for another may cause deep humiliation; annoy­
ance may turn to rage; shame may develop from slight guilt; apprehension 
may escalate to a panic attack or incapaciting terror. On the positive side, 
emotionally intense individuals may be idealistic and likely to fall in love at 
the drop of a hat. They may experience joy more easily, and thus may also 
be more susceptible to spiritual experiences. 
A number of investigators have found that increases in emotional arousal 
and intensity narrow attention, so that emotion-relevant stimuli become more 
salient and are more closely attended to (Easterbrook, 1959; Bahrick, Fitts, 
& Rankin, 1952; Bursill, 1958; Callaway & Stone, 1960; Cornsweet, 1969; 
McNamara & Fisch, 1964). The stronger the arousal and the greater the in­
tensity, the narrower the attention becomes. Clinically, these phenomena seem 
exceptionally characteristic of borderline individuals. It is an important point 
to keep in mind, however, that these tendencies are not pathological per se; 
they are characteristic of any individual during extreme emotional arousal. 
The relative paucity of theory and research examining the emotions as an­
tecedents of cognitions, compared to the lai^e amount on cognitions as precur­
sors to emotion, may be the consequence of our Western view of individual 
behavior as a produa of the rational mind (Lewis, Wolan-Sullivan, & Michal-
son, 1984). 
"Slow return to emotional baseline" means that reactions are long-lasting. 
It is important to note here, however, that all emotions are relatively brief, 
lasting from seconds to minutes. What makes an emotion feel long-lasting 
is that emotional arousal, or mood, tends to have a pervasive effect on a num­
ber of cognitive processes, which in turn are related to the aaivation and reac­
tivation of emotional states. Bower and his colleagues (Bower, 1981; Gilligan 
& Bower, 1984) have reviewed a large number of research studies indicating 
that emotional states (1) selectively bias the recall of affectively toned materi­
al, resulting in superior memory when the emotional state at recall matches 
the learning state; (2) enhance the learning of mood-congruent material; and 
(3) can bias interpretations, fantasies, projections, free associations, personal 
forecasts, and social judgments in a fashion congruent with current mood.

Dialectical and Biosocial Underpinnings of Treatment 45 
Emotions may also be more self-perpetuating among borderline individuals 
because of the greater intensity of their emotional responses, as suggested 
above. With high emotional arousal, the environment (including the therapist's 
behavior) can be selectively attended to, so that actions and events consistent 
with the current primary mood are attended to and other aspeas are negleaed. 
The effect of mood on cognitive processes makes sense in view of the 
theory that emotions are full-system responses. A current emotion integrates 
the entire system in its favor. In some senses, it is rather surprising that any 
emotion ever ends, since emotions, once started, are repeatedly retired. A slow 
return to emotional baseline exacerbates this reactivating effect; it also con­
tributes to high sensitivity to the next emotional stimulus. This characteris­
tic can be very important in treatment. It is not unusual for a borderline patient 
to say that it takes several days to recover from a psychotherapy session. 
Emotion Modulation 
The research on emotional behavior suggests that emotion regulation requires 
two somewhat paradoxical strategies. The individual must first learn to ex­
perience and label the discrete emotions that are hard-wired into the neu­
rophysiological, behavioral-expressive, and sensory-feeling systems. Then the 
individual must learn to reduce emotionally relevant stimuli that serve either 
to reactivate and augment ongoing negative emotions or to set off secondary 
dysfunaional emotional responses. Once an intense emotion is activated, the 
individual must be able to inhibit or interfere with the activation of mood-
congruent afterimages, afterthoughts, afterappraisals, afterexpectations, and 
afteractions, so to speak. 
Basic emotions are fleeting and generally adaptive (Ekman, Friesen, & 
Ellsworth, 1972; Buck, 1984). Constant inhibition or truncating of negative 
emotions seems to have a number of dysfunctional consequences. First, inhi­
bition can lead to neglea of the problem situation instigating the emotion. 
An individual who never experiences anger in the face of injustice is less like­
ly to remember unjust situations. Situations that are truly dangerous may not 
be avoided if fear is never experienced. Apologies may never be given and 
relationships may be left unrepaired when guilt or shame is always cut off 
before it can affect a person's behavior within a relationship. 
Second, the inhibition or truncating of negative emotions serves to in­
crease emotional avoidance. If the individual has learned a secondary emo­
tional reaction to negative emotions, the inhibition of the original emotion 
removes any chance of relearning. The paradigm is similar to the escape-
learning paradigm. Animals taught to escape from a chamber by having their 
feet shocked whenever they enter the chamber will cease to enter the cham­
ber; if the shock apparatus is subsequently turned off, the animals will never 
Team^the new contingencies. They must enter the chamber for new learning 
to occur. The invalidating family (which I describe later) is much like the shock 
apparatus in the escape-learning paradigm. Borderline individuals learn to 
--- Page 65 ---
46 THEORY AND CONCEPTS 
avoid negative emotional cues; they become negative-emotion-phobic. Without 
experiencing the negative emotions, however, the individual fails to leam that 
she can tolerate the emotions and that punishment will not follow their ex­
pression. 
Third, we simply do not know the outcomes of emotional inhibition and 
truncation over the long run. Research is desperately needed here. There is 
some evidence that emotional experiencing and catharsis lead to less stress­
ful negative emotional states. There is also evidence that emotional catharsis 
increases emotionality rather than reduces it (see Bandura, 1973, for a review 
of this research). Under what conditions emotional experiencing enhances 
versus interferes with therapeutic progress is an important question that has 
not been adequately addressed. 
John Gottman and Lynn Katz (1990) have outlined four emotion modu­
lation aaivities or abilities. These include the abilities to (1) inhibit inappropri­
ate behavior related to strong negative or positive affect, (2) self-regulate 
physiological arousal associated with affect, (3) refocus attention in the 
presence of strong affea, and (4) organize one self for coordinated aaion 
in the service of an external, non-mood-dependent goal. 
The principle of changing or modulating emotional experiences by chang­
ing or resisting emotion-linked behavior is one of the important principles 
underlying behavior therapy exposure techniques. Besides increasing emotion­
ality direaly, inappropriate, mood-dependent behavior usually leads to con­
sequences that elicit other unwanted emotions. Coordinated aaion in the 
service of an external goal serves to keep life progressing forward. Thus, such 
behavior has the long-term potential to enhance positive emotions, decrease 
stress and thereby reduce vulnerability to emotionality. In addition, such ac­
tion is the opposite of mood-dependent behavior, and thus is an instance of 
acting oneself into feeling different. I discuss these principles in some detail 
in Chapter 11. 
Changing emotions by changing physiological arousal is the principle 
behind a number of therapeutic emotion change strategies, such as relaxa­
tion therapies (including desensitization), some medications, and breathing 
training in the treatment of panic. The ability to modify physiological arousal 
associated with affect means that the individual is able not only to reduce 
the high arousal associated with some emotions, such as anger and fear (i.e., 
to calm down), but to increase the low arousal associated with other emo­
tions, such as sadness and depression (i.e. to "rev up," so to speak). Usually, 
this will require the ability to force activity, even when the person is not in 
the mood. For example, one of the basic techniques in cognitive therapy of 
depression is activity scheduling. 
The important role of controlling attention as a way to regulate contact 
with emotional stimuli has been pointed out by many (e.g., Derryberry & 
Rothbart, 1984,1988). Shifting attention toward a positive stimulus can en­
hance or maintain ongoing positive arousal and emotion; shifting it away from 
a negative stimulus may attenuate or contain negative arousal and emotion. 
--- Page 66 ---
Dialectical and Biosocial Underpinnings of Treatment 47 
Thus, individuals with control over attention focusing and attention shifting— 
two related but distinct processes (Posner, Walker, Friedrich, & Rafal, 1984) — 
have an advantage in regulation of emotional responses. In turn, individual 
differences in attention control are evident from the earliest years of life (Roth­
bart & Derryberry, 1981) and appear as stable temperamental characteris­
tics in adults (Keele & Hawkins, 1982; Derryberry, 1987; MacLeod, Mathews, 
& Tata, 1986). This point is particularly interesting, in light of data reviewed 
by Nolen-Hoeksema (1987) suggesting gender differences in attentional 
response sets under stress. She concludes that, at least when depressed, women 
have a more ruminative response set than men. Rumination about one's cur­
rent depressed mood, in tum, generates depressing explanations that increase 
depression further and lead to greater helplessness on future tasks (Diener 
& Dweck, 1978). In contrast, men are more likely to engage in distracting 
behaviors that dampen depressed mood. It seems reasonable to hypothesize 
that an inability to distraa oneself from negative, emotionally sensitive stimuli 
may be an important part of the emotion dysregulation found among bor­
derline individuals. 
Biological Underpinnings 
The mechanisms of emotion dysregulation in BPD are unclear, but difficul­
ties in limbic system reaaivity and attention control may be important. The 
emotion regulation system is a complex one, and there is no a priori reason 
to expect that the dysfunction will be the result of a common factor in all 
borderline individuals. Biological causes could conceivably range from genetic 
influences to disadvantageous intrauterine events to early childhood environ­
mental effects on development of the brain and nervous system. 
Cowdry et al. (1985) report data suggesting that some borderline individu­
als may have a low threshold for activation of limbic structures, the brain 
system associated with emotion regulation. In particular, they note the over­
lap among symptoms of complex partial seizures, episodic dyscontrol, and 
BPD. Positive benefits among borderline individuals for an anticonvulsant (car-
bamazepine) whose neurophysiological effects are known to be located in the 
limbic area lends further support to this notion (Gardner & Cowdry, 1986, 
1988). 
Other investigators have reported that patients with BPD have signifi­
cantly more elearoencephalographic (EEG) dysrhythmias than their depressed 
control patients (Snyder & Pitts, 1984; Cowdry et al., 1985). Andrulonis and 
his colleagues (Andrulonis et al., 1981; Akiskal et al., 1985a, 1985b) have 
attempted to link neurologically based dysfunctions to BPD. However, they 
did not employ comparison groups, and thus it is difficult to interpret their 
findings. In contrast, Cornelius et al. (1989) reviewed a number of studies 
in which borderline patients were compared with patients exhibiting various 
other psychiatric disorders. Generally, they reported no EEG differences; no 
differences in familial mental retardation, epilepsy, or neurological dis-
--- Page 67 ---
48 THEORY AND CONCEPTS 
orders; no differences on a broad battery of tests assessing major areas of 
cognitive functioning; and no differences in overall neurodevelopmental his­
tories. Interestingly, Cornelius et al. did report data indicating the early on­
set of borderline-type behavior patterns among borderline patients. For 
example, childhood temper tantrums and persistent rocking or head bang­
ing were more frequent among children later diagnosed as having BPD than 
among those later diagnosed as depressed or schizophrenic. 
Still another research strategy attempting to locate biological influences 
on behavior is the comparison of various behavioral dysfunctions in family 
members of the population of interest. Studies of first-degree relatives of bor­
derline patients have found higher prevalences of affeaive disorder (Akiskal, 
1981; Andrulonis et al., 1981; Baron, Gmen, Asnis & Lord, 1985; Loranger, 
Oldham, & Tuhs, 1982; Pope et al., 1983; Schulz et al., 1986; Soloff & Mill-
ward, 1983; Stone, 1981), of closely related personality traits such as histri­
onic and antisocial charaaeristics (Links, Steiner, & Huxley, 1988; Loranger 
et al., 1982; Pope et al., 1983; Silverman et al., 1987), and of borderline per­
sonality disorder (Zanarini, Gunderson, Marino, Schwartz & Frankenburg, 
1988) than among relatives of control groups. However, many other investi­
gators have failed to find similar associations when all relevant characteris­
tics have been controlled (see Dahl, 1990, for a review of this literature). A 
twin study by Torgersen (1984) supports a psychosocial over a genetic model 
of transmission. There has been little or no research attempting to link tem­
peramental charaaeristics of borderline individuals to data on the genetic and 
biological etiology of those particular temperamental attributes. Such research 
is sorely needed. 
Factors other than genes, however, may be equally important in deter­
mining neurophysiological funaioning, especially in the emotion regulation 
system. We know, for example, that charaaeristics of the intrauterine environ­
ment can be crucial in the development of the fetus. Furthermore, these charac­
teristics influence later behavioral patterns of the individual. Just a few 
examples will make my point here. Fetal alcohol syndrome, charaaerized by 
mental retardation and hyperaaivity, impulsiveness, distraaibility, irritabili­
ty, delayed development, and sleep disorders, is caused by maternal ingestion 
of excessive alcohol (Abel, 1981, 1982). Similar dysfunctions are regularly 
noted in babies of dmg-addiaed mothers (Howard, 1989). There is accumulat­
ing evidence that environmental stress experienced by the mother during preg­
nancy can have deleterious effeas on the later development of the child (Davids 
& Devault, 1962; Newton, 1988). 
Postnatal experiences can also have important biological consequences. 
It has been well established that radical environmental events and conditions 
can modify neural struaures (Dennenberg, 1981; Greenough, 1977). There 
is litde reason to doubt that neural struaures and functions related to emo­
tional behaviors are similarly affeaed by experiences with the environment 
(see Malatesta & Izard, 1984 for a review). The relationship of environmen­
tal trauma to emotion regulation is particularly salient in the case of BPD

given the prevalence of childhood sexual abuse among this population —a 
topic I discuss later in this chapter. 
Borderline Personality Disorder 
and Invalidating Environments 
The temperamental picture of the borderline adult is quite similar to that of 
the "difficult child" described by Thomas and Chess (1985). From their studies 
of temperamental characteristics of infants, they identified difficult children 
as the "group with irregularity in biological functions, negative withdrawal 
responses to new stimuli, non-adaptability or slow adaptability to change, 
and intense mood expressions that are frequently negative" (p. 219). In their 
research, this group comprised approximately 10% of their sample. Clearly, 
however, not all children with a difficult temperament grow up to meet criteria 
for BPD. Although the majority (70%) of difficult children studied by Chess 
and Thomas (1986) had behavior disorders during childhood, most of these 
children improved or recovered by adolescence. In addition, as Chess and Tho­
mas point out, children who originally do not have a difficult temperament 
may acquire one as they develop. 
Thomas and Chess have suggested that the "goodness of fit" or "poor­
ness of fit" of the child with the environment is crucial for understanding 
later behavioral functioning. Goodness of fit results when the properties of 
the child's environment and its expectations and demands are in accord with 
the individual's own capacities, charaaeristics, and style of behavior. Optimal 
development and behavioral functioning are the results. In contrast, poor­
ness of fit results when there are discrepancies and dissonances between en­
vironmental opportunities and demands and the capacities and charaaeristics 
of the child. In these instances, distorted development and maladaptive func­
tions result (Thomas & Chess, 1977; Chess & Thomas, 1986). It is this no­
tion of "poorness of fit" that I propose as crucial for understanding the 
development of BPD. But what kind of environment would constitute a "poor 
fit" leading to this particular disorder? I propose that an "invalidating en­
vironment" is most likely to facilitate development of BPD. 
Characteristics of Invalidating Environnnents 
An invalidating environment is one in which communication of private ex­
periences is met by erratic, inappropriate, and extreme responses. In other 
words, the expression of private experiences is not validated; instead, it is 
often punished, and/or trivialized. The experience of painful emotions, as 
well as the factors that to the emotional person seem causally related to the 
emotional distress, are disregarded. The individual's interpretations of her 
ovm behavior, including the experience of the intents and motivations associat­
ed with behavior, are dismissed. 
Invalidation has two primary characteristics. First, it tells the individual 
that she is wrong in both her description and her analyses of her own ex-
--- Page 69 ---
50 THEORY AND CONCEPTS 
periences, particularly in her views of what is causing her own emotions, be­
liefs, and aaions. Second, it attributes her experiences to socially unaccepta­
ble charaaeristics or personality traits. The environment may insist that the 
individual feels what she says she does not ("You are angry, but you just won't 
admit it"), likes or prefers what she says she does not (the proverbial "When 
she says no, she means yes"), or has done what she said she did not. Negative 
emotional expressions may be attributed to traits such as overreactivity, over-
sensitivity, paranoia, a distorted view of events, or failure to adopt a positive 
attitude. Behaviors that have unintended negative or painful consequences 
for others may be attributed to hostile or manipulative motives. Failure, or 
any deviation from socially defined success, is labeled as resulting from lack 
of motivation, lack of discipline, not trying hard enough, or the like. Positive 
emotional expressions, beliefs, and action plans may be similarly invalidated 
by being attributed to lack of discrimination, naivete, overidealization, or im­
maturity. In any case, the individual's private experiences and emotional ex­
pressions are not viewed as valid responses to events. 
Emotionally invalidating environments are generally intolerant of dis­
plays of negative affect, at least when such displays are not accompanied by 
public events supporting the emotion. The attitude communicated is similar 
to the "you can pull yourself up by the bootstraps" approach; it is the belief 
that any individual who tries hard enough can make it. Individual mastery 
and achievement are highly valued, at least with respea to controlling emo­
tional expressiveness and limiting demands on the environment. Invalidating 
members of such environments are often vigorous in promulgating their point 
of view and aaively communicate frustration with an individual's inability to 
adhere to a similar point of view. Great value is attached to being happy, or at 
least grinning in the face of adversity; to believing in one's capacity to achieve 
any objective, or at least never "giving in" to hopelessness; and, most of all, 
to the power of a "positive mental attitude" in overcoming any problem. Fail­
ures to live up to these expeaations lead to disapproval, criticism, and attempts 
on the part of others to bring about or force a change of attitude. Demands 
that a person can place on these environments are usually very restricted. 
This pattern is very similar to the pattern of high "expressed emotion," 
found in the families of both depressives and schizophrenics with high relapse 
rates (Leff & Vaughn, 1985). The work with expressed emotion suggests that 
such a family constellation can be extremely powerful with the vulnerable 
individual. "Expressed emotion," in that literature, refers to criticism and over-
involvement. The notion here includes those two aspeas, but in addition sttess-
es a nonrecognition of the actual state of the individual. The consequence 
is that the behaviors of others, including caregivers, in the individual's en­
vironment are not only invalidating of the individual's experiences but also 
nonresponsive to the needs of the individual. 
A few clinical examples may provide a better idea of what I mean here. 
During a family session with a borderline woman who had a history of alco­
holism and frequent serious suicide attempts, her son commented that he just 
--- Page 70 ---
Dialectical and Biosocial Underpinnings of Treatment 51 
didn't understand why she couldn't let problems "roll off her back" as he, 
his brother, and his father did. A substantial number of patients in my research 
project were actively dissuaded from going into psychotherapy by their par­
ents. One 18-year-old patient who had been hospitalized several times, had 
a history of numerous attempts to harm herself, was hyperactive and dyslex­
ic, and was heavily involved in the drug culture was told weekly by her par­
ents after her group therapy sessions that she did not need therapy and that 
she could just straighten up on her own if she really wanted to. "Talking about 
problems just makes problems worse," her father said. Another patient was 
told while growing up that if she cried when she got hurt playing, her mother 
would give her a "real" reason to cry: If the tears continued, her mother would 
hit her. 
Consequences of Invalidating Environnnents 
The consequences of invalidating environments are as follows. First, by fail­
ing to validate emotional expression, an invalidating environment does not 
teach the child to label private experiences, including emotions, in a manner 
normative in her larger social community for the same or similar experiences. 
Nor is the child taught to modulate emotional arousal. Because the problems 
of the emotionally vulnerable child are not recognized, little effort goes into 
attempts to solve the problems. The child is told to control her emotions, 
rather than being taught exactly how to do that. It is a bit like telling a child 
with no legs to walk without providing artificial legs for her to walk on. The 
nonacceptance or oversimplification of the original problems precludes the 
type of attention, support, and diligent training such an individual needs. 
Thus, the child does not learn to adequately label or control emotional 
reactions. 
Second, by oversimplifying the ease of solving life's problems, the en­
vironment does not teach the child to tolerate distress or to form realistic goals 
and expectations. 
Third, within an invalidating environment, extreme emotional displays 
and/or extreme problems are often necessary to provoke a helpful environ­
mental response. Thus, the social contingencies favor the development of ex-
tteme emotional reaaions. By erratically punishing communication of negative 
emotions and intermittently reinforcing displays of extreme or escalated emo­
tions, the environment teaches the child to oscillate between emotional inhi­
bition on the one hand, and extreme emotional states on the other. 
Finally, such an environment fails to teach the child when to trust her 
own emotional and cognitive responses as reflections of valid interpretations 
of individual and situational events. Instead, the invalidating environment 
teaches the child to actively invalidate her own experiences and to search her 
sodal environment for cues about how to think, feel, and aa. A person's ability 
to trust herself, at least minimally, is crucial; she at least has to tmst her deci­
sion not to trust herself. Thus, invalidation is ordinarily experienced as 
--- Page 71 ---
52 THEORY AND CONCEPTS 
aversive. People who are invalidated will usually either leave the invalidating 
environment, attempt to change their behavior so that it meets the expeaa­
tions of their environment, or try to prove themselves valid and thereby to 
reduce the environment's invalidation. The borderline dilemma arises when 
the individual cannot leave the environment and is unsuccessful at changing 
either the environment or her own behavior to meet the environment's 
demands. 
It might perhaps seems that such an environment would produce an adult 
with dependent personality disorder instead of BPD. I suspect that such an 
outcome would be likely with a less emotionally vulnerable child. But with 
an emotionally intense child, the invalidating information coming in from 
the environment is almost always competing with an equally strong message 
from the child's emotional responses: "You may be telling me that what you 
did was an aa of love, but my hurt feelings, terror, and rage tell me that it 
wasn't loving. You may be telling me that I can do it; and it's no big deal, 
but my panic is saying that I cannot and it is." 
The emotionally vulnerable, invalidated individual is in a bind similar 
to that of the overweight individual in our society. The culture (including daily 
weight reduction ads on TV and radio) and thin family members repeatedly 
tell the obese person that losing weight is easy; and keeping it off requires 
just a little will power. A body weight over the cultural ideal is thought to 
be the mark of a gluttonous, lazy, or undisciplined person. A thousand diets, 
intense hunger while dieting, herculean efforts to get and stay thin, and a 
body, that regains weight at the drop of a calorie say otherwise. How does 
the heavy person respond to this double message? Usually by alternating be­
tween dieting and extreme discipline on the one hand, and giving in, relax­
ing, and refusing to diet on the other. The yo-yo syndrome among dieters 
is similar to the emotional oscillation among borderline individuals. Neither 
source of information can be comfortably ignored. 
Varieties of Sexism: Prototypic Invalidating Experiences 
The prevalence of BPD among women requires that we examine the possible 
role of sexism in its etiology. Certainly, sexism is an important source of in­
validation for all women in our culture; just as certainly, all women do not 
become borderline. Nor do all women with vulnerable temperaments become 
borderline, even though all women are exposed to sexism in one form or 
another. I suspea that the influence of sexism in the etiology of BPD depends 
on other charaaeristics of the vulnerable child, as well as on the circumstances 
of sexism in the family raising the child. 
Sexual Abuse. The most extreme form of sexism is, of course, sexual 
abuse. The risk for sexual abuse is approximately two to three times greater 
for females than for males (Finkelhor, 1979). The prevalence of childhood 
sexual abuse in the histories of women meeting criteria for BPD is such that 
--- Page 72 ---
Dialectical and Biosocial Underpinnings of Treatment 53 
it simply cannot be ignored as an important factor in the etiology of the dis­
order. Of 12 hospitalized borderline patients assessed by Stone (1981), 9, or 
75%, reported a history of incest. Childhood sexual abuse was reported by 
86% of borderline inpatients compared, to 34% of other psychiatric inpa­
tients, in a study by Bryer, Nelson, Miller, and Krol (1987). Among border­
line outpatients, from 67% to 76% report childhood sexual abuse (Herman, 
Perry, & van der Kolk, 1989; Wagner, Linehan, & Wasson, 1989), in con­
trast to a 26% rate among nonborderline patients (Herman et al., 1989). 
Ogata, Silk, Goodrich, Lohr, and Westen (1989) found that 71% of border­
line patients reported a history of sexual abuse, compared to 22% of major 
depressive control patients. 
Although in epidemiological data girls are at no higher risk for physical 
abuse than boys are, one study found rates of reported childhood physical 
abuse to be higher among borderline patients (71%) than among nonborder­
line patients (38%) (Herman et al., 1989). Furthermore, there is a positive 
association between physical and sexual abuse (Westen, Ludolph, Misle, 
Ruffin, & Block, 1990), suggesting that those at risk for sexual abuse are 
at higher risk for physical abuse also. Bryer et al. (1987), however, found that 
whereas early sexual abuse predicted the diagnosis of BPD, the combination 
of sexual and physical abuse did not. Ogata et al. (1989) also reported simi­
lar rates of physical abuse in borderline and depressed patients. Thus, it may 
be that sexual abuse, in contrast to other types of abuse, is uniquely associated 
with BPD. Much more research is needed here to clarify the relationships. 
A very similar connection has been found between childhood sexual abuse 
and suicidal (including parasuicidal) behaviors. Viaims of such abuse have 
higher rates of subsequent suicide attempts than nonviaims do (Edwall, Hoff­
mann, & Harrison, 1989; Herman & Hirschman, 1981; Briere & Runtz, 
1986; Briere, 1988); up to 55% of these viaims go on to attempt suicide. 
Furthermore, sexually abused women engage in more medically serious 
parasuicidal behavior (Wagner et al., 1989). Bryer et al. (1987) found that 
childhood abuse (both sexual and physical) prediaed adult suicidal behavior. 
Individuals with suicide ideation or parasuicide were three times more likely 
to have been abused in childhood than were patients without such behaviors. 
Although it is generally viewed as a social stressor, child abuse may play 
a less obvious role as a cause of physiological vulnerability to emotion dys­
regulation. Abuse may not only be pathogenic for individuals with vulnera­
ble temperaments; it may "aeate" emotional vulnerability by affeaing changes 
in the central nervous system. Shearer, Peters, Quaytman, and Ogden (1990) 
suggest that perpetual trauma may physiologically alter the limbic system. 
Thus, severe, chronic stress may have permanent adverse effects on arousal, 
emotional sensitivity, and other factors of temperament. 
Sexual abuse, as it occurs in our culture, is perhaps one of the clearest 
examples of extreme invalidation during childhood. In the typical case scenario 
of sexual abuse, the victim is told that the molestation or intercourse is "OK" 
but that she must not tell anyone else. The abuse is seldom acknowledged 
--- Page 73 ---
54 THEORY AND CONCEPTS 
by other family members, and if the child reports the abuse she risks being 
disbelieved or blamed (Tsai & Wagner, 1978). It is difficult to imagine a more 
invalidating experience for the typical child. Similarly, physical abuse is often 
presented to the child as an aa of love or is otherwise normalized by the abus­
ive adult. Some clinicians have suggested that the secrecy of sexual abuse may 
be the factor most related to subsequent BPD. Jacobson and Herald (1990) 
reported that of 18 psychiatric inpatients with histories of major childhood 
sexual abuse, 44% had never revealed the experience to anyone. Feelings of 
shame are common among sexual abuse victims (Edwall et al., 1989) and 
may account for this failure to disclose the abuse. We cannot exclude the in­
validating component of sexual abuse as contributory to the BPD. 
Parental Imitation of Infants. Parents' tendencies to imitate an infant's 
emotionally expressive behaviors constitute an important factor in optimal 
emotional development (Malatesta & Haviland, 1982). Failure to imitate or 
noncongruent imitation—the former of which is failure to validate, and the 
latter of which is invalidation —are related to less optimal development. In­
terestingly, with respea to gender differences in the incidence of BPD, mothers 
tend to show more contingent responding to sons' smiles than to daughters' 
smiles and imitate sons' expressions more often than daughters' (Malatesta 
& Haviland, 1982).^ 
Dependence and Independence: Invalidating (and Impossible) Cultural 
Ideals for Women. The research data are overwhelming in confirming large 
differences between male and female interpersonal relationship styles. Flaherty 
and Richman (1989) have reviewed extensive data in the areas of primate be­
havior and evolution, developmental studies, parenthood, and adult social 
support and mental health. They conclude that various socialization ex­
periences, beginning at infancy, render women more affeaively conneaed and 
perceptive in the interpersonal sphere than men. The relationship between 
receiving social support from others and personal well-being, and, converse­
ly, the relationship between social support distress and somatic complaints, 
depression, and anxiety are stronger for females than for males. That is, 
whereas the degree of social support received is not closely related to emo­
tional functioning among men, it is highly correlated to emotional well-being 
among women. In particular, Flaherty and Richman (1989) found that the 
intimacy component of social support is most closely associated with well-
being among women. In reviewing research on assertion and women, Kelly 
Egan and I concluded that women's behavior in groups or dyads is consistent 
with an emphasis on maintaining relationships almost to the exclusion of 
achieving task objeaives, such as solving problems or persuading others (Line­
han & Egan, 1979). 
Given the prevalence of interpersonal bonding and social support as im­
portant (indeed, crucial), dimensions for well-adjusted women, one can ask 
--- Page 74 ---
Dialectical and Biosocial Underpinnings of Treatment 55 
this question: What happens to women who either are not given the social 
support they need or are taught that their very need for social support is it­
self unhealthy? Just such situations seem to exist. Almost without exception, 
interpersonal independence for both males and females is extolled as the ideal 
of "healthy" behavior. Feminine characteristics such as interpersonal depen­
dence and relying on others—which, as noted above, are positively related 
to women's mental health —are generally perceived as mentally "unhealthy" 
(Widiger & Settle, 1987). We so value independence that we apparently can­
not conceive of the possibility that a person could have too much indepen­
dence. For example, although there is a "dependent personality disorder" in 
the DSM-IV, there is no in "independent personality disorder." 
This emphasis on individual independence as normative behavior is 
unique to, and pervasive in, Westem culture (Miller, 1984; see Sampson, 1977, 
for a review of this literature). In fact, one can conclude that normative femi­
nine behavior, at least that part having to do with interpersonal relationships, 
is in a collision with current Western cultural values. It is no wonder that 
many women come to experience conflict over issues of independence and 
dependence. Indeed, it appears that there is a "poorness of fit" between wom­
en's interpersonal style and Western socialization and cultural values for adult 
behavior. It is interesting, however, that the pathology is laid on the doorstep 
of the conflicted women, rather than on that of a society that seems to be 
moving further and further away from valuing community and interpersonal 
dependency. 
Femininity and Bias. Sexism can be a special problem for those female 
children whose talents are those generally rewarded in men but often ignored 
or invalidated in women. For example, mechanical ability, sports achievements, 
interest in math and science, and logical, task-oriented thinking are valued 
more in men than in women. Any sense of pride or accomplishment can easi­
ly be invalidated in women with such characteristics. An even worse situa­
tion occurs when these talents valued in men are not matched by talents and 
interests valued in women (e.g., interest in appearing attraaive, home-oriented 
skills). In such a situation, the female child is not rewarded for the talents 
that she does have, and in addition is punished for emitting "unfeminine be­
haviors" or failing to emit "feminine" behaviors. When the child's behaviors 
are tied to temperamental characteristics, she is in further trouble. For exam­
ple, gentleness, softness, affection, responsiveness to others, empathy, nur­
turance and soothing, and similar characteristics are highly valued "feminine" 
associated characteristics (Widiger & Settle, 1987; Flaherty & Richman, 
1989); however, they are not the charaaeristics associated with a difficult tem­
perament. 
For the female child punished for having charaaeristics that interfere with 
her meeting the cultural ideal for women, life must be particularly difficult 
when she has brothers who are not punished for identical behaviors or sis­
ters who effortlessly meet standards for femininity. The injustice is not to 
--- Page 75 ---
56 THEORY AND CONCEPTS 
be missed in these situations. The environment outside the home does little 
in these cases to ameliorate the problem, since the same values are held across 
the culture. It is difficult to imagine how such a child could not grow up be­
lieving that there must be something wrong with her. 
In my clinical experience, just this state of affairs seems to be common 
among borderline patients. We have been struck in our clinic with the num­
ber of patients who are talented in areas valued highly in men but little in 
women, such as mechanical and intellectual pursuits. Our borderline group 
therapy is entirely female, and a frequent topic of discussion is the difficul­
ties the patients experienced as children because their interests and talents 
appeared more masculine than feminine. Another common experience seems 
to have been growing up in families that valued the boys more than the girls, 
or at least gave them more leeway, more privileges, and less punishment for 
the behaviors that led the girls to grief. Although sexism is clearly a fact, its 
relationship to BPD as I have described here is just as clearly speculative. We 
simply need more research data on this point. 
Types of Invalidating Families 
My colleagues and I have observed three types of invalidating families among 
patients in our clinic: the "chaotic" family, the "perfea" family, and, less com­
monly, the "typical" family. 
Chaotic Families. In the chaotic family, there may be problems with sub­
stance abuse, financial problems, or parents who are out of the home much 
of the time; in any case, little time or attention is given to the children. For 
example, the parents of one of my patients spent almost every afternoon and 
evening at a local tavern. The children came home from school each day to 
an empty house and were left to fend for themselves for dinner and structure 
in the evenings. Often they wandered over to a grandmother's for dinner. When 
the parents were home, they were volatile; the father was often drunk; and 
they could tolerate few demands from the children. Needs of the children in 
such a family are disregarded and consequently invalidated. Millon (1987a) 
has suggested that the increase in chaotic families may be responsible for the 
increase in BPD. 
Perfect Families. In the "perfect" family, the parents for one reason or 
another cannot tolerate negative emotional displays from their children. Such 
a stance may be the result of a number of factors, including other demands 
on the parents (such as a large number of children or stressful jobs), an in­
ability to tolerate negative affect, self-centeredness, or naive fears of spoiling 
a child with a difficult temperament. In my experience, when members of 
such a family are asked directiy about their feeling toward the borderline fam­
ily member, they express a great deal of sympathy. However, without mean­
ing to, these other members often express consistent invalidating attitudes —for 
--- Page 76 ---
Dialectical and Biosocial Underpinnings of Treatment 57 
example, expressing surprise that the borderline individual can't just "con­
trol her feeling." One such family member suggested that his daughter's very 
serious problems would be cured if she just prayed more. 
Typical Families. When I originally observed the invalidating environ­
mental style, I called it the "American way syndrome," since it is so prevalent 
in American culture. However, when I gave a lecture in Germany, my Ger­
man colleagues informed me that I could have called it the "German way syn­
drome." It is most likely a product of Western culture in general. A number 
of emotion theorists have commented on the tendency in Westem societies 
to emphasize cognitive control of emotions and to focus on achievement and 
mastery as criteria of success. The individuated self in Western culture is de­
fined by sharp boundaries between self and others. In cultures with this view, 
the behavior of mature persons is assumed to be controlled by internal rather 
than external forces. "Self-control," in this context, refers to the people's abil­
ity to control their own behavior by utilizing internal cues and resources. To 
define oneself differently—for example, to define the self in relation to others, 
or to be field-dependent—is labeled as immature and pathological, or at least 
inimical to good health and smooth societal functioning (Perloff, 1987). 
(Although this conception of the individual self pervades Western culture, it 
is universal neither cross-culturally nor even within Western culture itself.) 
A key point must be kept in mind about the invalidating family. Within 
limits, an invalidating cognitive style is not detrimental for everyone or in all 
contexts. The emotion control strategies used by such a family may even be 
useful at times to the person who is temperamentally suited to them and who 
can learn attitude and emotional control. For example, research by Miller 
and associates (Efran, Chomey, Ascher, & Lukens, 1981; Lamping, Molinaro, 
& Stevenson, 1985; Miller, 1979; Miller & Managan, 1983; Phipps & Zinn, 
1986) indicates that individuals who tend to psychologically "blunt" threat-
relevant cues when faced with the prospect of uncontrollable aversive events 
show lower and less sustained physiological, subjeaive, and behavioral arousal 
than individuals who tend to monitor or attend to such cues. Knussen and 
Cunningham (1988) have reviewed research indicating that belief in one's own 
behavioral control over negative outcomes, instead of blaming others (a key 
belief in the invalidating family), is related to more favorable future outcomes 
in a variety of areas. Thus, cognitive control of emotion can be quite effec­
tive in certain circumstances. Indeed, this approach got the railroad across 
the United States, built the bomb, got many of us through school, and put 
up skyscrapers in big cities! 
The only problem here is that the approach "only works when it works." 
That is, telling persons who are capable of affect self-regulation to control 
their emotions is quite a different proposition from telling this to an individual 
who does not have this capability. For example, one mother I was working 
with who had a 14-year-old daughter with a "difficult" temperament and a 
5-year-old daughter with an "easy" temperament. The older daughter had 
--- Page 77 ---
58 THEORY AND CONCEPTS 
difficulty with anger, especially when her little sister was teasing her. I was 
trying to teach the mother to validate this daughter's emotional reaaions. 
After the 5-year-old pushed a complex puzzle of the 14-year old's onto the 
floor, the older child screamed at her sister and stormed out of the room, 
leaving the sister in tears. The mother happily reported that she had "vali­
dated" the older daughter's emotions by saying, "Mary, I can understand why 
you got angry. But in the future, you have got to control your explosions!" 
It was difficult for the mother to see how she had invalidated the daughter's 
difficulties in controlling her emotions. In the cases of emotionally reactive 
and vulnerable persons, invalidating environments vastly oversimplify these 
person's problems. What other people succeed in doing—controlling emo­
tions and emotional expression—the borderline individual can often succeed 
at only sporadically. 
Emotion Dysregulation and Invalidating Environments: 
A Transactional Vicious Cycle 
A transaaional analysis suggests that a system that may originally have con­
sisted of a slightly vulnerable child within a slightly invalidating family can, 
over time, evolve into one in which the individual and the family environ­
ment are highly sensitive to, vulnerable to, and invalidating of each other. Chess 
and Thomas (1986) describe a number of ways in which the temperamental 
child, the slow-to-warm-up child, the distractible child, and the persistent 
child can overwhelm, threaten, and disorganize otherwise nurturing parents. 
Patterson (1976; Patterson & Stouthamer-Loeber, 1984) has also written ex­
tensively on the interactive behaviors of child and family that lead to mutual­
ly coercive behavior patterns on the part of all parties in the system. Over 
time, children and caregivers shape and reinforce extreme and coercive be­
haviors in each other. In turn, these coercive behaviors further exacerbate the 
invalidating and coercive system, leading to more, not fewer, dysfunctional 
behaviors within the entire system. One is reminded of a Biblical quotation: 
". . . for anyone who has will be given more; from anyone who has not, even 
what he thinks he has will be taken away" (Luke 8:18; The Jerusalem Bible, 
1966). 
There is no question that an emotionally vulnerable child puts demands 
on the environment. Parents or other caregivers have to be more vigilant, more 
patient, more understanding and flexible, and more willing to put their own 
wishes for the child on temporary hold when these wishes exceed the child's 
capabilities. Unfortunately, what often happens is that the child's response 
to invalidation actually reinforces the family's invalidating behavior. Telling 
a child that her feelings are stupid or unwarranted does at times quiet the 
child down. Many people, including those wdth emotional vulnerability, some­
times withdraw and appear to feel better when their emotions are made light 
of. Invalidation is aversive, and thus suppresses the behavior it follows. 
The "controlling" environment described by Chess and Thomas (1986) 
--- Page 78 ---
Dialectical and Biosocial Underpinnings of Treatment 59 
is a variation or extreme example of the invalidating environment described 
here. The controlling environment constantly shapes the child's behavior to 
fit the family's preferences and convenience rather than the child's short- and 
long-term needs. In that situation, of course, the validity of the child's be­
havior as it exists is not recognized. As the child matures, power struggles 
are inevitable, with the environment sometimes appeasing and giving in and 
at other times rigidly holding the line. Depending on the child's initial tem­
perament, the eventual result of appeasement is a child tyrant, a child with 
negative passivity, or both. The manner of this development is described over 
and over again in manuals on parenting. 
In essence, the error in such a family is twofold. First, the caregivers make 
an error in shaping. That is, they expect more or different behaviors than 
the child is capable of emitting. Excessive punishment and insufficient model­
ing, instructing, coaching, cheerleading, and reinforcement follow. Such a pat­
tern creates an aversive environment for the child, in which needed help is 
not forthcoming and unavoidable punishment occurs. As a result, the child's 
negative emotional behaviors increase, including the expressive behaviors that 
are associated with the emotions. These behaviors function to terminate 
punishment, usually by creating such aversive consequences for the caregivers 
that they stop attempts at control. 
And here caregivers make the second error: They reinforce the function­
al value of extreme expressive behaviors, and extinguish the funaional value 
of moderate expressive behaviors. Such a pattern of appeasement following 
extreme emotional displays can unwittingly create the pattern of behaviors 
associated with BPD in the adult. When appeasement from others does not oc­
cur, or occurs unprediaably, the unavoidability of aversive conditions mimicks 
the leamed helplessness paradigm: Passive, helpless behaviors can be expeaed 
to increase. If passive or helpless behaviors are in turn punished, the person 
is faced with an unwinnable dilemma and will probably vacillate between ex-
tteme emotionally expressive behaviors and equally extreme passive and help­
less behaviors. Such a state of affairs can, without too much difficulty, account 
for the emergence of many borderline characteristics as the child matures. 
Emotion Dysregulation and Borderline Behaviors 
Very little in human behavior is not affected by emotional arousal and mood 
states. Such diverse phenomena as concepts of the self, self-attributions, per­
ceptions of control, leaming of tasks and performance, pattems of self-reward, 
and delay of gratification are affected by emotional states (see Izard, Kagan, 
& Zajonc, 1984, and Garber & Dodge, 1991, for reviews). The thesis here 
is that most borderline behaviors are either attempts on the part of the in­
dividual to regulate intense affea or outcomes of emotion dysregulation. Emo­
tion dysregulation is both the problem the individual is trying to solve and 
the source of additional problems. The relationship between borderline be­
havior patterns and emotion dysregulation is depicted in Figure 2.2.

Emotion Dysregulation and Impulsive Behaviors 
Suicidal and other impulsive, dysfunctional behaviors are usually maladap­
tive solution behaviors to the problem of overwhelming, uncontrollable, in­
tensely painful negative affea. Suicide, of course, is the ultimate way to change 
one's affective state (we presume). Other, less lethal (e.g., parasuicidal) be­
haviors, however, can also be quite effeaive. Overdosing, for example, usually 
leads to long periods of sleep; sleep, in turn, has an important influence on 
regulating emotional vulnerability. Cutting and burning the body also seem 
to have important affect-regulating properties. The exact mechanism here is 
unclear, but it is common for borderline individuals to report substantial relief 
from anxiety and a variety of other intense negative affective states following 
cutting themselves (Leinbenluft, Gardner, & Cowdry, 1987). 
Suicidal behavior, including suicide threats and parsuicide, is also very 
effective in eliciting helping behaviors from the environment —help that may 
be effective in reducing the emotional pain. In many instances, in fact, such 
behavior is the only way an individual can get others to pay attention to and 
try to ameliorate her emotional pain. For example, suicidal behavior is a most 
effective way for a nonpsychotic individual to be admitted to an inpatient 
psychiatric unit. Many therapists tell their patients that they can or should 
phone them if they are feeling suicidal. The staff at a psychiatric inpatient 
unit in my area used to tell one of our patients that she could come right 
--- Page 80 ---
Dialectical and Biosocial Underpinnings of Treatment 61 
back in if she got "command voices" telling her to commit suicide. In our 
clinical population of parasuicidal borderline women, a majority report that 
the intent to change their environment is part of at least one instance of 
parasuicidal behavior. 
Unfortunately, the instrumental charaaer of suicide threats and parasui­
cide is frequently the most salient one for therapists and theorists working 
with borderline individuals. Thus, suicide attempts and other intentional self-
injurious behaviors are often referred to as "manipulative." The basis of this 
reference is usually a therapist's own feeling of being manipulated. As I have 
discussed in Chapter 1, however, it is a logical error to assume that if a be­
havior has a particular effect, the actor has therefore engaged in the behavior 
in order to bring about the effect. The labeling of suicidal behavior as 
manipulative, in the absence of an assessment of the aaual intent of the be­
havior, can have extremely deleterious effeas. This issue is discussed further 
in the Chapter 15 where I describe treatment strategies for suicidal behaviors. 
Emotion Dysregulation and Identity Disturbance 
Generally, people form a sense of self-identity through their own observa­
tions of themselves as well as through others' reactions to them. Emotional 
consistency and predictability across time and similar situations are prerequi­
sites to this development of identity. All emotions involve some element of 
preference or approach-avoidance. A sense of identity, among other things, 
is contingent on preferring or liking something consistently. For example, a 
person who always enjoys drawing and painting may develop an image of 
herself that includes aspeas of an artist's identity. Others observing this same 
preference may react to the person as an artist, further developing her image 
of herself. Unpredictable emotional lability, however, leads to unprediaable 
behavior and cognitive inconsistency; thus a stable self-concept, or sense of 
identity, fails to develop. 
A tendency of borderline patients to inhibit, or attempt to inhibit, emo­
tional responses may also contribute to an absence of a strong sense of iden­
tity. The numbness associated with inhibited affect is often experienced as 
emptiness, further contributing to an inadequate (and at times completely 
absent) sense of self. Similarly, if an individual's own sense of events is never 
"correct" or is unpredictably "correct"—the situation in the invalidating 
family—then one would expect the individual to develop an overdependence 
upon others. This overdependence, especially when the dependence relates 
to preferences, ideas, and opinions, simply exacerbates problems with iden­
tity, and a vicious cycle is once again started. 
Emotion Dysregulation and Interpersonal Chaos 
Effective interpersonal relations are enormously benefited by both a stable 
sense of self and a capacity for spontaneity in emotional expression. Success-
--- Page 81 ---
62 THEORY AND CONCEPTS 
ful relationships also require a capacity to self-regulate emotions in appropriate 
ways, to control impulsive behavior, and to tolerate stimuH that produces pain 
to a certain degree. Without such capabilities, it is understandable that bor­
derline individuals develop chaotic relationships. Difficulties with anger and 
anger expression, in particular, preclude the maintenance of stable rela­
tionships. 
In addition, as I discuss further in Chapter 3, the combination of emo­
tional vulnerability with an invalidating environment leads to the develop­
ment of more intense and more persistent expressions of negative emotions. 
Essentially, the invalidating environment usually places the individual on an 
intermittent reinforcement schedule, in which expressions of intensely nega­
tive affea or demands for help are reinforced sporadically. Such a schedule 
is known to create very persistent behavior. When people currently involved 
with the borderline person also fall into the trap of inconsistently appeasing 
her—sometimes giving in to and reinforcing high-rate, high-intensity aver­
sive emotional expressions and other times not doing so —they are recreating 
conditions for the person's learning of relationship-destruaive behaviors. 
Implications of the Biosocial Theory for 
Therapy with Borderline Patients 
General Aims and Skills Taught 
Recognition of these emotion regulation difficulties, originating in both bio­
logical makeup and inadequate learning experiences, suggests that treatment 
should focus on the twin tasks of teaching the borderline patient (1) to modu­
late extreme emotionality and reduce maladaptive mood-dependent behaviors, 
and (2) to trust and validate her own emotions, thoughts, and aaivities. The 
therapy should focus on skills training and behavior change, as well as on 
validation of the patient's current capabilities and behaviors. 
A major portion of DBT is devoted to teaching just such skills. The skills 
are broken down into four types: (1) those that increase interpersonal effec­
tiveness in conflia situations, and thus show promise in decreasing environ­
mental stimuli associated with negative emotions; (2) strategies culled from 
the behavioral treatment literature on affective disorders (depression, anxie­
ty, fear, anger) and posttraumatic stress, which increase self-regulation of un­
wanted emotions in the face of aaual or perceived negative emotional stimuli; 
(3) skills for tolerating emotional distress until changes are forthcoming; and 
(4) skills adapted from Eastern (Zen) meditation techniques, such as mind­
fulness practice, which increase the ability to experience emotions and avoid 
emotional inhibition. 
Avoiding "Blaming the Victim" 
The successful extinction of maladaptive, extreme emotional displays is con­
tingent on a number of factors. Most importantly, a validating environment 
--- Page 82 ---
Dialectical and Biosocial Underpinnings of Treatment 63 
must be created that allows the therapist to extinguish maladaptive behaviors 
while at the same time soothing, comforting, and cajoling the patient through 
the experience. The process is tricky and requires an enormous amount of 
therapist tolerance, willingness to experience emotional pain, and flexibility 
Often, however, in conducting therapy, therapists may apply to borderline 
patients the same expeaations as those placed on other patients. When the 
borderline patients cannot meet these expeaations, the therapists may be toler­
ant for a period. But as the patients' display of negative emotions increases, 
the therapists' patience or willingness to tolerate the pain they themselves are 
experiencing runs out, and they then appease, punish, or terminate therapy 
with these patients. Clinicians experienced in working with borderline pa­
tients have perhaps recognized themselves in the earlier descriptions of in­
validating, controlling environments and of the families who get caught in 
the vicious cycle of appeasing and punishing these patients. Such an environ­
ment, when recapitulated in therapy, is simply a continuation of the invalidat­
ing environment that the patients have experienced throughout their lives. 
A most typical form of punishment of borderline patients consists of be­
haviors that, in sum, are both invalidating of the patients and "blaming the 
victims." Research in social psychology suggests that a number of faaors are 
important in determining whether observers will blame viaims of misfortune 
for their own misfortune. Relevant to the present topic are findings that in 
general, females are blamed more for misfortunes than are males in compara­
ble situations (Howard, 1984). In the same research, Howard also found that 
when a victim is female, observers attribute blame to her character. However, 
when a victim is male, observers attribute blame to the male's behavior in 
the situation, not to his character. Other variables are also important: The 
observer has to care about the misfortune of the victim; the consequences 
have to be severe (Walster, 1966); and the observer has to feel helpless in con­
trolling the outcome (Sacks & Bugental, 1987). Thus, when people care about 
what happens to others, they do not want these others to suffer, but they 
cannot keep misfortune or suffering from happening; they are likely to blame 
the viaims for their own misfortune and suffering. 
This is exactly the situation of therapy with most borderline patients. 
First, the "viaims" are primarily women. Usually, their therapists care whether 
they are suffering. And certainly, few therapies to date have been shown to 
be particularly effective in stopping that suffering. Even if therapists believe 
that a particular treatment will be effective in the long run, because it has 
worketl with other patients, helplessness in the face of the borderlines' in­
tense suffering —suffering that causes the therapists reciprocal pain—is the 
repeated, day-to-day experience of working with these individuals. In the face 
of this helplessness the therapists may redouble their efforts. When the pa­
tients still do not improve, the therapists may begin to say that they are caus­
ing their own distress. The patients don't want to improve or change. They 
are resisting therapy (After all, it works with almost everyone else.) They are 
playing games. They are too needy In short, the therapists make a very fun-
--- Page 83 ---
64 THEORY AND CONCEPTS 
damental but quite prediaable cognitive error: They observe the consequence 
of behavior (e.g., emotional suffering for the patients or themselves) and at­
tribute that consequence to intemal motives on the part of the patients. I refer 
to this error repeatedly in further discussions of treatment of borderline pa­
tients. 
"Blaming the victim" has important iatrogenic effeas. First, it invalidates 
an individual's experience of her own problems. What the individual ex­
periences as attempts to end pain are mislabeled as attempts to maintain the 
pain, to resist improving, or to do something else that the individual is not 
aware of. Thus, the individual learns to mistrust her own experience of her­
self. After some time, it is not unusual for the person to learn the point of 
view of the therapist, both because she does not tmst her own self-observations 
and because doing so leads to more reinforcing outcomes. I once had a pa­
tient who was having immense trouble managing her homework practice; 
either she would not praaice, or her practice attempts would not be success­
ful. Simultaneously, she was repeatedly entreating me and my group coleader 
to help her feel better. One week, when I asked her what had interfered with 
her practicing her homework, she said with great conviction that she obvi­
ously did not want to be happy. If she did, she would have praaiced her 
homework. 
A key component of DBT is its insistence that the therapist refrain from 
blaming the victim for her own problems. This is not a position based on 
simple naivete, although I have been accused of that. First, the caregiver's 
blaming of the victim usually leads to emotional distancing, negative emo­
tions directed at the patient, decreased willingness to help, and punishment 
of the patient. Thus, the very help that is needed is more difficult to give. 
The caregiver becomes frustrated and often, but usually very subtly, strikes 
out at the patient. Because the punishment is not aimed at the aaual source 
of the problem, it simply increases the patient's negative emotionality. A power 
struggle ensues —one that neither the patient nor the therapist can win. 
Concluding Comments 
It is important to keep in mind that the dialectical position presented here 
is a philosophical position. Thus, it can be neither proved nor disproved. For 
many, however, it is a difficult position to grasp. You may not see the need 
for it at first. Certainly, you can adopt some of DBT without necessarily em­
bracing (or understanding) dialectics. If you are like me and my students, 
however, the idea will become more appealing over time and will subtly change 
your conceptualization of therapy issues. For me, it has had a profound ef­
fect on the way I conduct psychotherapy and the way I organize my treat­
ment unit. DBT has been growing and changing continuously; the emerging 
implications of a dialectical perspective have been a source of much of the 
growth.

Dialectical and Biosocial Underpinnings of Treatment 65 
The biosocial theory I am presenting here is speculative. There has been 
little prospective research to document the application of this approach to 
the etiology of BPD. Although the theory is in accord with the known litera­
ture on BPD, no research has been mounted so far to test the theory prospec­
tively. Thus, the reader should keep in mind that the logic of the biosocial 
formulation of BPD described in this chapter is based largely on clinical ob­
servation and speculation rather than on firm empirical experimentation. Cau­
tion is recommended. 
Notes 
1. My assistant at the time, Elizabeth Trias actually first pointed out the rela­
tionship of my experience to dialectics. Her husband was a student of Marxist 
philosophy. 
2. Behaviors can also occur with or without awareness or attention and subse­
quently may be verbally reportable or unreportable by the individual. In more com­
mon parlance, they may or may not be available to consciousness. (See Greenwald, 
1992, for a discussion of the emerging respectability of unconscious cognition in ex­
perimental psychology.) 
3. There are a number of good reviews of research on basic emotional function­
ing. The reader is refered to the following: Barlow (1988), Buck (1984), Garber and 
Dodge (1991), Ekman, Levenson, and Friesen (1983), Izard, Kagan, and Zajonc (1984), 
Izard and Kobak (1991), Lang (1984), Lazarus (1991), Malatesta (1990), Schwartz 
(1982), and Tomkins (1982) for further reviews of this literature. 
4. Kelly Koerner first pointed out that emotion dysregulation could be consi­
dered as the product of vulnerability plus the inability to modulate emotions. 
5. Gerry Dawson and Mark Greenberg brought this finding and its relevance 
to invalidation to my attention.

Behavioral Patterns: 
Dialectical Dilemmas in 
the Treatment of 
Borderline Patients 
D escribing behavioral charaaeristics 
associated with BPD is a time-honored tradition. As Chapter 1 indicates, in­
numerable lists of borderline charaaeristics have been proposed over the years; 
thus, it is with some trepidation that I present yet another such list. The be­
havioral patterns discussed in this chapter, however, are not presented as di­
agnostic or definitional for BPD, nor are they a complete summary of 
important borderline charaaeristics. My views on these patterns evolved over 
a period of years while I struggled to get behavior therapy to work effeaively 
for chronically parasuicidal and borderline patients. As I struggled, I felt that 
I was repeatedly being tripped up by the same sets of patient characteristics. 
Through the years, by a reciprocal process of observing (both in the clinic 
and the research literature) and constructing, I developed a picture of dialec­
tical dilemmas posed by the borderline patient. The behavioral pattems as­
sociated with these dilemmas constitute the topic of this chapter. 
Although these patterns are common, they are by no means universal 
among patients meeting criteria for BPD; thus, it is extremely important that 
their presence in a given case be assessed, not assumed. Given this caveat, 
I have found it useful for both myself and the patients to be aware of the in­
fluence on therapy of these particular patterns. Generally, their description 
strikes a resonant chord with the patients I treat and helps them achieve a 
better organization and understanding of their own behaviors. Since the seem­
ingly inexplicable nature of their behavior (especially repetitive self-injuries) 
is often an important issue, this is no small achievement. Furthermore, the 
66

patterns and their interrelationships can have heuristic value in clarifying the 
development of the patients' problems. 
These dilemmas are best viewed as a group of three dimensions defined 
by their opposite poles. These dialeaical dimensions, illustrated in Figure 3.1 
are as follows: (1) emotional vulnerability versus self-invalidation; (2) active 
passivity versus apparent competence; and (3) unrelenting crises versus in­
hibited grieving. If each dimension is conceptually divided at its midpoint, 
the characteristics above the midpoint—emotional vulnerability, aaive pas­
sivity, and unrelenting crises—are the ones that have been more influenced 
during development by the biological substrata for emotion regulation. Cor­
respondingly, the characteristics below the midpoint—self-invalidation, ap­
parent competence, and inhibited grieving—have been more influenced by 
the social consequences of emotional expression. A key point about these 
patterns is that the discomfort of the extreme points on each of these dimen­
sions insures that borderline individuals vacillate back and forth between the 
polarities. Their inability to move to a balanced position representing a syn­
thesis is the central dilemma of therapy.

teristics. One of these borderline characteristics is continuing emotional 
vulnerability—that is, continuing emotional sensitivity, emotional intensity, 
and tenacity of negative emotional responses. Such vulnerability is, from my 
perspective, a core characteristic of BPD. When I discuss emotional vulner­
ability at this level, I am referring both to the individual's actual vulnerabil­
ity and to her own simultaneous awareness and experience of that vulnerability. 
There are four normal charaaeristics of frequent, high emotional arousal 
that make matters particularly difficult for the borderline individual. First, 
one must keep in mind that emotions are not simply internal physiological 
events, although physiological arousal certainly forms an important part of 
emotions. As I discussed more fully in Chapter 2, emotions are full-system 
responses. That is, they are integrated pattern of experiential, cognitive, and 
expressive, as well as physiological, responses. One component of a complex 
emotional response is not necessarily more basic than another. Therefore, 
the problem is not simply that borderline individuals cannot regulate physio­
logical arousal; rather, they often have difficulty regulating the entire pattern 
of responses associated with particular emotional states. For example, they 
may not be able to modulate the hostile facial expression, aggressive action 
patterns, or verbal attacks associated with anger. Or they may not be able 
to interrupt obsessional worries or to inhibit escape behaviors associated with 
fear. If this point is kept in mind, then it is easier to understand the complex­
ity of the problem facing borderline patients, as well as their tendency to be 
at times inexplicably dysfunctional across a wide range of behavioral areas. 
Second, intense emotional arousal typically interferes with other ongo­
ing behavioral responses. Thus, regulated, planned, and apparently funaional 
coping behaviors can at times fall apart when interrupted by emotionally re­
lated stimuli. The frustration and disillusionment when this happens simply 
make matters worse. Furthermore, high arousal is associated with dichoto­
mous, either-or thinking; obsessional and perseverative thought; physical dis­
tress, complaints, and illness; and avoidance and/or attack behaviors. 
Third, high arousal and the inability to regulate it lead to a sense of be­
ing out of control and a certain unpredictability about the self. The unpredic­
tability stems from the borderline person's inability to control the onset and 
offset of internal and external events that influence emotional responses, as 
well as an inability to modulate her own response to such events. It is made 
worse by the fact that at unpredictable times the individual does succeed at 
controlling her emotional responses. The problem here is that the timing and 
duration of this emotional regulation is unpredictable to the individual (and 
to others as well). The quality of this experience for the borderline person 
is that of a nightmare she cannot wake up from. 
Finally, this lack of control leads to some specific fears that increase emo­
tional vulnerability still further. First, the borderline person fears situations 
where she has less control over events (usually new situations, as well as those 
where previous difficulties have been experienced). The borderline patient's 
frequent attempts to gain control of the therapeutic situation make perfect 
--- Page 88 ---

sense once this aspect of emotional vulnerability is understood. Second, the 
patient often has an intense fear of behavioral expectations from individuals 
she cares about. This fear is reasonable in light of the faa that she experiences 
dyscontrol not only of private emotional responses, but also of behavior pat­
tems that are contingent on particular emotional states. (For example, studying 
for an exam requires an ability to concentrate that may be difficult to main­
tain during periods of high anxiety, overwhelming sadness, or intense anger.) 
Dyscontrol and unprediaability make environmental expeaations fraught with 
difficulty. The patient can meet expectations at one moment, in one emo­
tional state, that she may not be able to meet at another time. 
An important aspea of this particular problem is the association of praise 
with expectations. Praise, besides communicating approval, also commonly 
communicates an acknowledgment that the individual can emit the praised 
behavior and an expectation that she can do so again in the future. This is 
precisely what the borderline individual believes she may not be able to do. 
Although I have presented the fear of praise here as cognitively mediated, such 
mediation is not necessary. All that is required is that the individual has past 
experiences where praise is followed by expectations; expectations are fol­
lowed by failure to meet the expectations; and disapproval or punishment fol­
lows. Just such a sequence of behaviors is typical in the invalidating 
environment. 
The net effect of these emotional difficulties is that borderline individu­
als are the psychological equivalent of third-degree bum patient. They simply 
have, so to speak, no emotional skin. Even the slightest touch or movement 
can create immense suffering. Yet, on the other hand, life is movement. Ther­
apy, at its best, requires both movement and touch. Thus, both the therapist 
and the process of therapy itself cannot fail to cause intensely painful emo­
tional experiences for the borderline patient. Both the therapist and the pa­
tient must have the courage to encounter the pain that arises. It is the 
experience of their own vulnerability that sometimes leads borderline individu­
als to extreme behaviors (including suicidal behaviors), both to try to take 
care of themselves and to alert the environment to take better care of them. 
Completed suicide among borderline individuals is inevitably an aa of final 
hopelessness that the vulnerability will ever lessen. It is sometimes also a last 
communication that more care was needed. 
Understanding this vulnerability and keeping it in mind are crucial for 
therapeutic effectiveness. All too often, unfortunately, therapists fail or for­
get to recognize borderline patients' vulnerability. The problem is that whereas 
burn victims' sensitivity and the reason for it are apparent to all, borderline 
individuals' sensitivity is often hidden. For reasons that I discuss later, bor­
derline individuals tend at times to appear to others, including their ther­
apists, deceptively less emotionally vulnerable than they are. One consequence 
of this state of affairs is that the sensitivity of borderline patient's is far more 
difficult to comprehend and keep in mind than that of burn viaims. We can 
imagine not having physical skin; it is harder for most of us to imagine what 
--- Page 89 ---
70 THEORY AND CONCEPTS 
life would be like if we were always emotionally vulnerable or did not have 
psychological skin ourselves. That is the life of borderline patients. 
Anger and Borderline Personality Disorder 
Difficulties with anger have been part of the definition of BPD in each edi­
tion of the DSM since 1980. In psychoanalytic thought (e.g., Kernberg's 
theories; see Kernberg, 1984), an excess of hostile affect is viewed as a fun­
damental etiological factor in the development of BPD. Much of the current 
treatment of borderline patients is aimed at interpreting behavior in light of 
its presumed underlying hostility and aggressive intent. A noted psychoanalyst 
once said to me that all phone calls from patients to therapists at home are 
aas of aggression. Nearly every time I show a videotape of a therapy session 
with one of my own patients, someone in the audience interprets a patient's 
silence, withdrawal, or passive behavior as an aggressive attack on me. Pa­
tients in our group therapy often discuss their difficulties in convincing other 
mental health professionals that their behavior, or at least some of it, is not 
a reflection of angry and hostile feelings. 
Clearly, the experience of anger and hostile/aggressive behaviors play an 
important role in BPD. However, from my perspective, other negative emo­
tions such as sadness and depression; shame, guilt, and humiliation; and fear, 
anxiety, and panic are equally important. It stands to reason that a person 
who is emotionally intense and has generalized difficulty regulating emotions 
will have specific problems with anger. But whether all or most of borderline 
behavior is interpreted as associated with anger seems to me to depend large­
ly on who is interpreting the behavior rather than on the aaual behavior or 
its motivation. Often hostile intent is inferred simply on the basis of aversive 
consequences of the behavior. If the patient's behavior is frustrating or an­
noying to the therapist, then the patient must mean it to be so—if not cons­
ciously, then unconsciously. Although I have no data to back up this point, 
I sometimes wonder also whether the tendency to infer anger and aggression 
rather than fear and desperation is not tied to the gender of the observer. 
One of the few true gender differences is that males are more aggressive than 
females (Maccoby & Jacklin, 1978); perhaps men are also more likely to see 
aggressive intent. Theorists who have promulgated anger and coping with 
hostile motives as essential in the etiology of BPD are, of course, men (e.g., 
Kernberg, Gunderson, Masterson).' 
In my experience, much of the borderline behavior that is interpreted 
as stemming from hostile motives and anger stems in reality from fear, panic, 
hopelessness, and desperation. (This is similar to Masterson's [1976] posi­
tion that fear of abandonment underlies much of borderline psychopatholo­
gy.) The patient who on one of my videotapes is silent and nonresponsive 
is often struggling to control a panic attack that includes (according to her 
later descriptions) sensations of choking and fears of dying. Although the 
panic response itself may stem from the initial, rudimentary experience of 
--- Page 90 ---
Behavioral Patterns: Dialectical Dilemmas 71 
anger-related feelings, thoughts, or bodily reactions, this does not mean that 
the subsequent behavior is aggressive per se or hostile in intent. The overin-
terpretation of anger and hostile intent, however, can itself generate hostility 
and anger. Thus, such interpretations create a self-fulfilling prophecy espe­
cially when rigidly applied. 
Although problems with anger and anger expression may reflect more 
generalized emotional intensity and dysregulation, they may also be a conse­
quence of other dysregulated negative affeaive states. Arousal of negative emo­
tions and discomfort of any kind can activate anger-related feelings, action 
tendencies, and thoughts and memories. Leonard Berkowitz (1983, 1989, 
1990) has proposed a cognitive-neoassociationistic model of anger forma­
tion. The basic idea is that as a result of various genetic, learned, and situa­
tional factors, negative affect and discomfort aaivate an associative network 
of initial, rudimentary fear and anger experiences. Subsequent higher order 
cognitive processing of the initial aversive experience and affea may then give 
rise to the full development of the anger emotion and experience. According 
to Berkowitz, therefore, anger and its expression are likely consequences (rather 
than causes) of more generalized emotional intensity and dysregulation of 
negative emotional states. He reviews a fair body of data to demonstrate that 
negative emotional states and discomfort other than anger can produce an­
gry feelings and hostile inclinations. In line with this position, Berkowitz has 
written that "suffering is seldom ennobling. It is the unusual individual among 
humanity in general whose charaaer is improved as a result of undergoing 
painful or even merely unpleasant experiences. . . . When [all] people feel 
bad, they are all too likely to have angry feelings, hostile thoughts and 
memories and aggressive inclinations" (Berkowitz, 1990, p. 502). 
Unregulated anger and anger expression can, of course, cause any num­
ber of other life difficulties. This may be especially the case among women, in 
whom even mild expressions of anger may be interpreted as aggression. For 
example, behavior that is labeled as "assertive" in men may be labeled "ag­
gressive" in women (Rose & Tron, 1979). Perceived aggression begets retalia­
tory aggression, and thus the cycle of interpersonal conflia is born. Depend­
ing on one's previous leaming history, the emotion of anger itself may also 
be experienced as so unacceptable that it sets off further emotional reactions 
of shame and panic. These emotions themselves may contribute to an escala­
tion of the original anger response, increasing distress still further. Or attempts 
to block direa anger expression and inhibit the emotional response may de­
velop. With time, a pattern of expressive inhibition and overcontrol of anger 
experiences may become the preferred manner of responding to anger-provok­
ing situations. Passive, helpless behavior may ensue. I take up the topic of the 
relative merits of direa anger expression versus inhibition later in this chapter. 
Self-invalidation 
"Self-invalidation" refers to the adoption by an individual of charaaeristics of

72 THEORY AND CONCEPTS 
the invalidating environment. Thus, the borderline individual tends to invali­
date her own affective experiences, to look to others for accurate reflections 
of external reality, and to oversimplify the ease of solving life's problems. In­
validation of affective experiences leads to attempts to inhibit emotional ex­
periences and expression. The person's failure to trust her own perceptions 
of reality prohibits development of a sense of identity or confidence in her 
own self. Oversimplification of life's difficulties leads inevitably to self-hate 
following failure to achieve goals. 
Outside of clinical observations, empirical support for self-invalidation 
among borderline individuals is meager. However, a number of problems with 
emotions can be expected as a result of experiencing an invalidating environ­
ment. First, the experience itself of negative emotions can be affected by the 
invalidating environment. The pressure to inhibit negative emotional expres­
sions interferes with developing the ability to sense postural and muscular 
expressive (especially facial) changes associated with basic emotions. Such 
sensing is an integral part of emotional behavior. Second, in such an environ­
ment the individual does not learn to label her own negative emotional reac­
tions accurately. Thus, the ability to articulate emotions clearly and to 
communicate them verbally does not develop. Such inability further increases 
the emotional invalidation that the environment, and eventually the individual 
herself, delivers. It is difficult for a person to validate an emotional experience 
that she does not understand. 
A third effect of an invalidating environment, especially when basic emo­
tions such as anger, fear, and sadness are invalidated, is that a person in such 
an environment does not learn when to trust her own emotional responses 
as valid reflections of individual and situational events. Thus, she is unable 
to validate and trust herself. That is, if a child is told that she should not 
be experiencing particular emotions, then she has to doubt her original ob­
servations or interpretations of reality. If communication of negative emo­
tions is punished, as it often is in an invalidating environment, then a response 
of shame follows experiencing the intense emotion in the first place and ex­
pressing it publicly in the second. Thus, a new secondary negative emotion 
is set in motion. The person learns to respond to her own emotional responses 
as her environment has modeled—with shame, criticism, and punishment. 
Compassion for self, and compassionate self-directed behaviors, rarely de­
velop in such an atmosphere. A vicious cycle is set up, since one effective way 
to reduce the shame following negative emotions is to get the environment 
to validate the original emotion. Often the borderline individual learns that 
either an extreme emotional display or presentation of extreme circumstances 
is necessary to provoke a validating environmental response. In such an en­
vironment, the individual learns that both escalation of the original emotional 
response and exaggerated, but convincing, presentation of negative circum­
stances elicit validation from the environment. Sometimes other positive 
responses, such as nurturance and warmth, come along with the validation. 
The individual thus flips back to the emotionally vulnerable pole of this dimen-
--- Page 92 ---
Behavioral Patterns: Dialectical Dilemmas 73 
sion of borderline experience. The alternative to seeking validation from the 
environment is simply to change or at least to modulate one's emotional 
responses in accord with environmental expectations; the inability to regu­
late affect, however, precludes such a solution for the borderline individual. 
In such an environment, it is understandable that the child develops a 
tendency to scan the environment for what to think and how to feel. The 
child is punished for relying on private experiences. This pattern of events 
can account for the problems many borderline patients have in maintaining 
a point of view in the face of disagreement or criticism, as well as for their 
frequent tendency to try to extract validation for their point of view from 
the environment. If relying on private experiences has not been rewarded, and 
conforming to public experiences has been, an individual has two options: 
She can try to change the public's experience by persuasive taaics, or she can 
change her own experience to conform to the public experience. In my ex­
perience, borderline patients tend to cycle between these two options. 
As the cycle continues, both the original emotional distress and the sub­
sequent shame and self-criticism increase. Breaking into such a cycle can be 
particularly difficult for the therapist. At one and the same time, the patient 
is seeking validation for a painful emotion and communicating such intense 
distress that the therapist empathetically wishes to help reduce the pain as 
quickly as possible. The most common mistake therapists make in such in­
stances is to move to change the painful original affea (thereby invalidating 
it), rather than to validate the original emotion and thereby reduce the sur­
rounding shame. 
A fourth effect of invalidating environments is that individuals adopt the 
invalidating behavior change tactics and apply these tactics to themselves. 
Thus, borderline individuals often set unreasonably high behavioral expec­
tations for themselves. They simply have no concept of the notion of 
shaping—that is, gradual improvement. Thus, they tend to berate and other­
wise punish rather than to reward themselves for approximations to their goal 
behaviors. Such a self-regulation strategy insures failure and eventual giving 
up. I have rarely encountered a borderline patient who could spontaneously 
use reward over punishment as a method of behavior change. Although punish­
ment may be very effeaive in the short term, it is often ineffeaive over the 
long run. Among other negative effeas, punishment, especially in the form 
of self-criticism and blame, elicits guilt. Although moderate guilt may be an 
efficient way to motivate behavior, excessive guilt, like any intense negative 
emotion, can disrupt thought and behavior. Often, to reduce the guilt these 
individuals simply avoid the situation that generate the guilt, thereby avoid­
ing the requisite behavior changes to correct the problem. Persuading bor­
derline patients to forgo punishment and utilize principles of reinforcement 
is one of the major struggles of behavior therapy with them. 
The preference for punishment over reinforcement probably arises from 
two sources. First, since punishment is the only behavior change tactic she 
knows, a borderiine individual fears that if she does not apply severe punish-
--- Page 93 ---
74 THEORY AND CONCEPTS 
ment to herself, she will slip even further from desired behaviors. The conse­
quence of such slippage is further dyscontrol of her own behavior, and there­
fore of rewards from the environment. The fear is such that attempts by the 
therapist to interfere with the punishment cycle sometimes elicit a panic 
response. Second, an invaHdating environment with its emphasis on individual 
responsibility, teaches that transgressions from desired behavior merit punish­
ment. Borderline patients often find it difficult to believe that they deserve 
anything other than punishment and pain. Indeed, a number report that they 
deserve to die. 
The Dialectical Dilemma for the Patient 
The juxtaposition of an emotionally vulnerable temperament with an in­
validating environment presents a number of interesting dilemmas for the bor­
derline patient and has important implications for understanding suicidal 
behavior in particular, especially as it occurs in psychotherapy. The patient's 
first dilemma has to do with whom to blame for her predicament. Is she evil, 
the cause of her own troubles? Or, are other people in the environment or 
fate to blame? The second, closely related dilemma has to do with who is 
right. Is the patient really vulnerable and unable to control her own behavior 
and reaaions, as she feels herself to be? Or is she bad, able to control her 
reaaions but unwilling to do so, as the environment tells her? What the bor­
derline individual seems unable to do is to hold both of these contradiaory 
positions in mind at the same time, or to synthesize them. Thus, she vacil­
lates between the two poles. Put simplistically, the borderline patients I see 
frequently travel between these two opposing orientations to their own be­
havior. Either they invalidate themselves with a passion and believe that all 
bad things that happen to them are fair consequences of their own evilness; 
or they validate their own vulnerability, often simultaneously invalidating fate 
and the laws of the universe, believing that all of the negative things that hap­
pen to them are unfair and should not be happening. 
At the first of these extremes, the borderline individual adopts the emo­
tionally invalidating attitude herself, often in an extreme manner, oversim­
plifying the ease of achieving behavioral goals and emotional goals. The 
inevitable failure associated with such excessive aspirations is met with shame, 
extreme self-criticism, and self-punishment, including suicidal behavior. The 
person deserves to be the way she is. The suffering she has endured is justi­
fied because she is so bad. Problems in living are the result of their own will­
fulness. Failure is attributed to lack of motivation, even in the face of evidence 
to the contrary. They resemble the powerful person who despises anyone weak, 
or the terrorist who attacks those who show fear. Rarely have I seen such 
vengeance as that of borderline individuals' hatred toward themselves. One 
patient of mine becomes so outraged at herself that in sessions she has clawed 
her face and legs, leaving long raw scratches. Suicide or parasuicide, from 
this orientation, is primarily an act of self-directed hostility. 
--- Page 94 ---
Behavioral Patterns: Dialectical Dilemmas 75 
At the other extreme, the borderline individual at times is keenly aware 
of her emotional and behavioral lack of control. Aspirations are consequent­
ly lowered by the individual, but not by the environment. Recognition of the 
discrepancy between her own capacities for emotional and behavioral con­
trol, and excessive demands and criticism on the part of the environment, 
can lead to both anger and attempts to prove to significant individuals the 
error of their ways. How better to do that than suicidal behavior or some 
other form of extreme behavior? Such communication can be essential if the 
person is to get the help she believes is needed. It is especially likely, of course, 
when an invalidating interpersonal environment responds in a compassion­
ate and helpful manner only to extreme expressions of distress. Also, the bor­
derline person does not have clear guidelines as to what she should believe 
when there is a disagreement—her own experience or that of others, particu­
larly the therapist's. Suicidal behavior validates the individual's own sense of 
vulnerability, reducing the ambiguity of the double messages coming from 
her own experience versus that of the therapist. 
From this orientation, borderline individuals not only validate their own 
vulnerability, but also invalidate the behavioral and biological laws that have 
been instrumental in making and keeping them what they are. They are acutely 
aware of the unfairness of their existence. At times they believe that some­
how the universe is capable of being fair, is fair to almost everyone else, should 
have been fair to them in the first place, and could be fair to them if they 
simply figure out the right things to do. At other times, however, they are 
extremely hopeless that they will in fact ever figure out the right things to 
do. They may experience themselves as good people, or at least wanting to 
be, with uncontrollable and thereby hopeless flaws. Each behavioral trans­
gression is followed by intense shame, guilt, and remorse. They are vases in 
a pottery shop that are cracked, broken, and ugly, put on the back shelf where 
customers do not see them. Although they try their best to find glue to repair 
themselves, or fresh clay to refashion their shape, their efforts are ultimately 
not enough to render them acceptable. 
In the center of intense emotional pain and vulnerability, the borderline 
individual frequently believes that others (particularly the therapist) could 
take away the pain if only they would. (One could almost say that they have 
trust disorder as opposed to paranoid disorder!) The collision of this firm 
and sometimes stridently expressed expectation with the therapist's equally 
intense experience of helplessness anad ineffectiveness sets the stage for one 
of the most frequent dramas in therapy with borderline patients. In the face 
of inadequate help, the patient's emotional pain and out-of-control behavior 
escalate. The patient feels uncared for, deeply hurt, and misunderstood. The 
therapist feels manipulated and equally misunderstood. Both are poised to 
withdraw or attack. 
Patience, acceptance, and self-compassion, together with gradual attempts 
at change, self-management, and self-soothing, are both the ingredients and 
the outcome of synthesis of vulnerability and invalidation. They elude the 
--- Page 95 ---

borderline individual, however. Interestingly, such a pattern of altemating ex­
cessive and depressed aspirations has also been found to charaaerize individu­
als who have (in a Pavlovian sense) weak, highly reaaive nervous systems—that 
is, who are emotionally vulnerable (Krol, 1977, cited by Strelau, Farley, & 
Gale, 1986). 
The Dialectical Dilemma for the Therapist 
These two interrelated patterns may provide us a clue as to why therapy with 
the borderline patient is sometimes iatrogenic. To the extent that the ther­
apist creates an invalidating environment within the therapy, then the patient 
may be expected to react strongly. Common instances of invalidation include 
a therapist's offering or insisting on an interpretation of behavior that is not 
shared by the patient; setting firm expectations for performance over what 
the patient can (or believes she can) accomplish; treating the patient as less 
competent than she actually is; failing to give the patient the help that would 
be given if the therapist believed the patient's current perspective to be valid; 
criticizing or otherwise punishing the patient's behavior; ignoring important 
communications or actions of the patient; and so on. Suffice it to say that 
in most therapy relationships (even good ones) a fair amount of invalidation 
is common. In a stressful relationship, such as that with a borderline patient, 
there is probably even more. 
The experience of invalidation is generally aversive, and a borderline pa­
tient's emotional reactions to it may vary: anger at the therapist for being 
so insensitive; a feeling of intense dysphoria at being so misunderstood and 
alone; anxiety and panic because of the feeling that a therapist who cannot 
understand and validate the patient's current state cannot help; or shame and 
humiliation at experiencing and expressing such emotions, thoughts, and be­
haviors. Behavioral reaaions to invalidation can include avoidance behaviors, 
increased efforts at communication and gaining validation, and attacking the 
therapist. The most extreme form of avoidance, of course, is suicide. Less 
drastically, the patients may simply quit therapy or start missing or coming 
late for sessions. (The high therapy dropout rates among borderline and 
parasuicidal patients probably result, in part, from difficulties therapists have 
in validating these patients.) Depersonalization and dissociative phenomena 
can be other forms of avoidance, as can simply shutting down and verbally 
withdrawing within therapy sessions. A patient may increase communication 
efforts by various means, including calling the therapist between sessions, mak­
ing extra appointments, writing letters, and soliciting friends or other men­
tal health professionals to call the therapist. As I have noted above, suicidal 
behaviors can at times serve as communication attempts. (It is crucial, however, 
that the therapist not assume that all suicidal behavior is communication be­
havior.) 
Attacks on the therapist are most often verbal: The patient judges and 
blames, with little empathy for the difficulties the therapist may be experienc-

ing in trying to understand and validate the patient. In my time, I have been 
called more pejorative names and had my motives attacked more often by bor­
derline patients than by any other group of individuals I can think of. At times, 
however, attacks on the therapist can be physical; these often consist of at­
tacks on the property of the therapist. For example, patients in our clinic have 
broken clocks, tom bulletin boards apart, stolen mail, thrown objeas, kicked 
holes in walls, and written graffiti on walls. Such attacks, of course, set up 
a reciprocal cycle, because the thetapist often attacks the patient back. Coun­
terattacks by a therapist are often disguised as therapeutic responses. 
The dilemma for the therapist is that attempts at inducing change in the 
patient and sympathetic understanding of the patient as she is are equally 
likely to be experienced as invalidating. For example, in reviewing how a par­
ticular interaaion went wrong or why some goal was not reached, if the ther­
apist in any way implies that the patient could improve her performance the 
next time, the patient is likely to respond that the therapist must be assuming 
that the patient has been wrong all along and that the invalidating environ­
ment is right. A battle ensues, and attention to behavior change and skill train­
ing is diverted. In my experience, many of the day-to-day difficulties in treating 
this population result from therapists' invalidation of patients' experiences 
and difficulties. On the other hand, if a therapist uses a non-change oriented 
taaic—listening to the patient or sympathetically validating the patient's 
responses—then the patient is likely to panic at the prospea that life will never 
improve. If she is right, and has been right all along, then this must be the 
best that can be hoped for. In this case the therapist can expea eventual anger 
for not being more helpful. Demands for more therapist involvement and con­
crete suggestions for change ensue. A vicious cycle is begun—one that often 
wears out both patient and therapist alike. 
The experience of this dilemma, perhaps more than anything else, was 
my primary impetus for developing DBT. Standard behavior therapy (includ­
ing standard cognitive-behavioral therapy) by itself, at least as I practiced it, 
invalidated my patients. I was telling them that either their behavior was wTong 
or their thinking was irrational or problematic in some way. Therapies that 
failed to teach, however, failed to recognize the very real skill deficits of these 
individuals. Accepting their pain invalidated it in some senses. It was like be­
ing an expert swimmer with a life raft handy, leaving people who couldn't 
swim to fend for themselves in the middle of the ocean, yelling (in a soothing 
voice); "You can make it! You can stand it!" The solution, at least in DBT, 
has been to combine the two treatment strategies. Thus, the treatment calls 
for a therapist to interact with a patient in a flexible manner that combines 
keen observation of patient reaaions with moment-to-moment changes in 
the use of supportive acceptance versus confrontation and change strategies. 
The dialectical balance that the therapist must strive for is to validate 
the essential wisdom of each patient's experiences (especially her vulnerabili­
ties and sense of desperation), and to teach the patient the requisite capabili­
ties for change to occur. This requires the therapist to combine and juxtapose

validation strategies with capability enhancement strategies (skills training). 
The tension created the patient's altemating excessively between high and low 
aspirations and expectations relative to her own capabilities offers a formid­
able challenge to the therapist. 
Active Passivity versus Apparent Competence 
Active Passivity 
The defining characteristic of "active passivity" is the tendency to approach 
problems passively and helplessly, rather than actively and determinedly, as 
well as a corresponding tendency under extreme distress to demand from the 
environment (and often the therapist) solutions to life's problems. Thus, the 
individual is aaive in trying to get others to solve her problems or regulate 
her behavior, but is passive about solving problems on her own. This mode 
of coping is quite similar to "emotion-focused coping," described by Lazarus 
and Folkman (1984). Emotion-focused coping consists of responding to stress-
provoking situations with efforts to reduce the negative emotional reaaions 
to the situation —for example, by distracting or seeking comfort from others. 
This contrasts with "problem-focused coping," in which the individual takes 
direct action to solve the problem. It is this tendency to seek help actively 
from the environment that differentiates active passivity from learned help­
lessness. In both cases, the individual is helpless in solving her own prob­
lems. However, in learned helplessness, the individual simply gives up and 
does not even try to get help from the environment. In active passivity, the 
person continues to try to solicit problem solutions from others, including 
the therapist. 
At times it is this very demand for an immediate problem solution from 
the therapist, when the therapist does not have one to give, that leads into 
the cycle of invalidating the patient. Escalating, desperate demands can precipi­
tate a crisis for a therapist. In the face of such helplessness, he or she may 
begin either to blame or to rejea the "victim." Such rejection further exacer­
bates the problem, leading to further demands, and the vicious cycle is born. 
Passivity in the face of overwhelming and apparently unsolvable problems 
with hfe and self-regulation, of course, does not help remediate such problems, 
although it may be effective at short-term regulation of the negative affect 
that accompanies them. The question of whether problems are indeed solv­
able is, of course, often a bone of contention between patient and therapist. 
The therapist may believe that the problems can be solved if the patient will 
just begin to engage actively in coping; by contrast, the patient often views 
them as hopeless no matter what she does. From the patient's perspective, 
either there is no solution or there is no problem-solving behavior that the 
patient believes herself able to produce. The patient's self-efficacy beliefs are 
discrepant from the therapist's beliefs in the patient's inherent problem-solving 
ability Indeed, a passive regulation style, including distraction and problem 
--- Page 98 ---
Behavioral Patterns: Dialectical Dilemmas 79 
avoidance, may even be encouraged by the therapist if the therapist also views 
the problems as unsolvable. 
A passive self-regulation style is probably a result of the individual's tem­
peramental disposition as well as the individual's history of failing in attempts 
to control both negative affects and associated maladaptive behaviors. For 
example, Bialowas (1976) (cited by Strelau et al., 1986) found a positive rela­
tionship between high autonomic reaaivity and dependency in a social in­
fluence situation. Interesting research by Eliasz (1974, cited by Strelau et al. 
1986) suggests that people with high autonomic reaaivity, independent of 
other considerations, will prefer passive self-regulation styles—that is, styles 
that involve minimal active efforts to improve their own abilities and their 
environment. 
Miller and Mangan (1983) conduaed research relevant to this topic on 
patients' behaviors during medical visits. They found that patients who were 
alert for and sensitized to the negative or potentially negative aspects of an 
experience ("high monitors") were more highly concerned with being treated 
with kindness and respect, getting tests done, getting new prescriptions, get­
ting reassurance about the effeas of stress on their health, and wanting more 
information than were "low monitors." Most important to the points here, 
they also desired a less active role in their own medical care; in faa, twice 
as many high monitors as low monitors wanted to play a completely passive 
role in their own care. Thus, active passivity may not be entirely a result of 
leaming, although a history of failing in efforts to control both themselves 
and aversive environments is very likely important. 
It is easy to see how an active-passivity orientation can be learned. Bor­
derline individuals observe their frequent inability to interaa successfully. They 
are aware of their own unhappiness, hopelessness, and inability to see the 
world from a positive point of view, as well as their simultaneous inability 
to maintain an uncracked facade of happiness, hope, and untroubled calm. 
These observations can lead to a pattern of learned helplessness. The ex­
perience of failure despite one's best efforts is often a precursor of such a pat­
tern. In addition, in an environment where difficulties are not recognized, 
the individual never learns how to deal with problems aaively and effeaive­
ly. Learning such coping strategies requires, at a minimum, the recognition 
of a problem. In an environment where difficulties are minimized, an individu­
al leams to magnify them so that they will be taken seriously. It is this mag­
nified view of difficulties and incompetence that further charaaerizes active 
passivity. The individual balances the failure to recognize inadequacy with 
extreme inadequacy and passivity. 
Empirical support for the aaive-passivity pattem can be found in work 
on both parasuicidal and borderline individuals. In my research, inpatients 
admitted for an immediately preceding parasuicide, compared to both sui­
cide ideators and nonsuicidal psychiatric inpatients, showed markedly lower 
aaive interpersonal problem solving and somewhat higher passive problem 
solving. Aaive problem solving in this research consisted of an individual's 
--- Page 99 ---
80 THEORY AND CONCEPTS 
taking actions that led to problem resolution; passive problem solving con­
sisted of getting another person to solve the problems (Linehan et al., 1987). 
Perry and Cooper (1985) report an association between BPD and low self-
efficacy, high dependency, and emotional reliance on others. 
The inability to protect themselves from extreme aversive emotions, and 
the consequent sense of helplessness, hopelessness, and desperation, can be 
important factors in borderline individuals' frequent interpersonal overdepen-
dency. People who cannot solve their own affeaive and interpersonal problems 
must either tolerate the aversive conditions or reach out to others for problem 
resolution. When the psychic pain is extreme and/or distress tolerance is low, 
this reaching out turns to emotional clinging and demanding behaviors. In 
turn, this dependency prediaably leads to intense emotional responses to the 
loss or threat of loss of interpersonally significant people. Frantic attempts 
to avoid abandonment are consistent with this constellation. 
The role of cultural gender bias and sex-role stereotypes in inducing ac­
tive passivity on the part of women cannot be overlooked. In general, females 
tend to learn interpersonal achievement styles that are effeaive because they 
elicit help and protection from others (Hoffman, 1972). Furthermore, wom­
en are often restricted by cultural norms and expeaations to indirea, per­
sonal, and helpless modes of influence (Johnson, 1976). Gender differences 
show up at an early age. Observation studies of school children, for exam­
ple, indicates that following criticism boys respond with aaive efforts, whereas 
girls tend more to fall into the passive mode of giving up and blaming their 
own abihties (Dweck & Bush, 1976; Dweck, Davidson, Nelson, & Emde, 
1978). Although school-age girls do not, in general, have more stressful events 
than do school-age boys (Goodyer, Kolvin, & Gatzanis, 1986), it is possible 
that girls experience more situations that fit the leamed helplessness paradigm 
than do boys. Certainly, the data on sexual abuse suggest such a possibility. 
As I have discussed in some detail in Chapter 2, the degree of social support 
received—in particular, the degree of intimacy—is more closely associated with 
well-being among women than among men. Thus, the emotional dependence 
characteristic of borderline individuals may at times be simply an extreme 
variation of an interpersonal style common to many women. It is also possi­
ble that the dependent style characteristic of borderline individuals would not 
be viewed as pathological in other cultures. 
Apparent Competence 
"Apparent competence" refers to the tendency of borderline individuals to ap­
pear competent and able to cope with everyday life at some times, and at 
other times to behave (unexpectedly, to the observer) as if the observed com­
petencies did not exist. For example, an individual may act appropriately as­
sertive in work settings where she feels confident and in control, but may 
be unable to produce assertive responses in intimate relationships where she 
feels less in control. Impulse control while in the therapist's office may not 
--- Page 100 ---
Behavioral Patterns: Dialectical Dilemmas 81 
generalize to settings outside his or her office. A patient who appears to be 
in a neutral or even positive mood when she leaves a therapy session may 
call the therapist hours later and report extreme distress as a result of the 
session. Several weeks or months of successful coping with life's problems 
may be followed by a crisis and behavioral retreat to ineffective coping and 
extreme emotion dysregulation. An ability to regulate affea expression in some 
social situations may seem completely absent in other situations. In many 
instances, borderline individuals exhibit very good interpersonal skills and 
are often good at assisting others in dealing with their own problems in liv­
ing; yet they cannot apply these same skills to their own lives. 
The idea for the apparent-competence pattern first came to me in work­
ing with one of my patients, whom I will call Susan. Susan was a systems 
analyst for a large corporation. She came to therapy well dressed, had an at­
tractive demeanor, was humorous, and reported good performance reviews 
at work. Over a number of months, she repeatedly asked me for advice on 
how to handle interpersonal problems with her boss. She appeared very in­
terpersonally competent, however, and I was convinced that she had the requi­
site skills. So I kept trying to analyze the factors inhibiting her use of skills 
I presumed she already had. She continued to insist that she simply couldn't 
think of how to approach her boss on particular matters. Although I still be­
lieved that she really had the requisite skills, I suggested one day, in exaspera­
tion and frustration, that we role-play how to handle a particular situation. 
I played her and she played her boss. After the role play, she expressed amaze­
ment at how I had handled the situation. She remarked that she had simply 
never thought of that way of approaching the problem. She readily agreed 
to approach her boss and use the new approach I had modeled. The next 
week she reported success. Certainly, this interaaion did not prove that Susan 
did not have the requisite capabilities before our role play. Perhaps the role 
play conveyed information about the social rules for behavior with bosses; 
perhaps I simply gave her "permission" to use skills she already had. But I 
could not discount the possibility that I had insisted Susan had skills that 
she, in fact, did not have in the situation where she needed them. 
A number of faaors seem to be responsible for the apparent competence 
of the borderline individual. First, the individual's competence is extremely 
variable and conditional. As Millon (1981) has suggested, the borderline per­
son is "stably unstable." The observer, however, expeas competencies that 
are expressed under one set of conditions to generalize and be expressed un­
der similar (to the observer) conditions. However, in the borderline individual, 
such competencies often do not generalize. Data on situation-specific leaming 
suggest that generalization of behaviors across different situational contexts 
is not to be expeaed in many cases (see Mischel, 1968, 1984, for reviews); 
what makes the borderline patient unique is the influence of mood-dependent 
learning combined with situation-specific learning. In particular, behavioral 
capabilities that the individual has in one mood state she frequentiy does not 
have in another. If, furthermore, the individual has Httle control of emotional 
--- Page 101 ---
82 THEORY AND CONCEPTS 
states (which is to be expeaed of persons with deficient emotional regula­
tion), then for all praaical purposes she has littie control over her behavioral 
capabihties. 
A second faaor influencing apparent competence has to do with the bor­
derline individual's failure to communicate her vulnerability clearly to the other 
significant people in her life, including the therapist. At times the borderline 
individual automatically inhibits nonverbal expression of negative emotional 
experiences even when such expression is appropriate and expected. Thus, 
she may be experiencing inner turmoil and psychic pain while at the same 
time communicating apparent calmness and control. Her manner often ap­
pears competent and communicates to others that she is feeling fine and in 
control. The competent appearance is sometimes enhanced by the border­
line individual's adopting and expressing the beliefs of her environment— 
namely, that she is competent across related situations and over time. In one 
mood state or context, the individual has difficulty prediaing herself in differ­
ent states or situations. This smiling, competent facade is easily mistaken by 
others for an accurate refleaion of transsituational reality under all or most 
conditions. When in another emotional state or situation the individual com­
municates helplessness, the observer often interprets such behavior as simply 
feigning helplessness to get attention or to frustrate others. 
This inhibition of negative emotional expression probably stems from 
the social learning effects of being raised in an invalidating environment. As 
Chapter 2 has described, invalidating environments reward the inhibition of 
negative affea expression. Emphasis is put on achievement, personal con­
trol, and smiling in the face of adversity.^ To make matters even more diffi­
cult, most borderline patients in my experience are unaware that they are not 
communicating their vulnerability. One of two things may be happening here. 
First, an individual sometimes communicates verbally that she is in distress, 
but her nonverbal cues do not support such a message. Or the patient may 
discuss a personally vulnerable topic and experience intensely negative af­
fect, but may not communicate (verbally or nonverbally) the experience of 
that affect. In either instance, however, the patient typically believes that she 
has communicated clearly. In the first case, she believes that a simple descrip­
tion of how she feels, independent of nonverbal expressiveness, is sufficient. 
She may not be aware that the nonverbal message is discordant. In the sec­
ond case, the patient believes that the context itself is sufficient communica­
tion. Yet when others fail to pick up the message, the individual is usually 
quite distressed. This failure is understandable, however, since most individuals 
faced with discrepant verbal and nonverbal affea cues will trust the nonver­
bal over the verbal cues. 
I have had patients who calmly and in an ordinary tone say to me, almost 
offhandedly, that they are so depressed they are thinking of killing themselves. 
Or a patient may talk about a recent rejection, stating that she feels frantic 
at the loss, in a voice as casual as if she were discussing the weather. One 
of my patients, who was single and heavier than norms for women her age, 
--- Page 102 ---
Behavioral Patterns: Dialectical Dilemmas 83 
would inevitably get extremely despondent when talking about either her 
weight or her marital status; however, except for the topic, I would never have 
known. Indeed, the patient presented such a cogent argument for a feminist 
perspective that I might have reasonably believed that she had mastered her 
cultural conditioning on the topics. Discussions of sexual abuse often have 
the same effea. 
A third factor influencing apparent competence has to do with the bor­
derline individual's reaaion to interpersonal relationships. The typical pa­
tient I work with appears to have access to emotional and behavioral 
competence under two conditions: Either she is in the aaual presence of a 
supportive, nurturing individual, or she perceives herself to be in a secure, 
supportive, and stable relationship with a significant other person even when 
the other person is not physically present. This is perhaps why the borderline 
individual often appears so competent when with her therapist; usually, the 
therapist is a supportive, nurturing individual. Rarely, however is the ther­
apeutic relationship itself perceived as secure and stable. Thus, when the ther­
apist is not present, the influence is reduced. Although this may be due to 
a failure in evocative memory, as Adler (1985) suggests, it also may have to 
do with the generally less secure nature of a therapeutic relationship. Indeed, 
therapy relationships are defined by the faa that they end. For many border­
line patients, they end prematxurely and abruptly. The beneficial effeas of rela­
tionships, of course, are not unique to borderiine patients; we all do better 
when we have stable, supportive social support networks (see Sarason, Sara­
son, & Shearin, 1986, for a review). The difference is the magnitude of the 
discrepancy between borderline patients' capabilities in and out of suppor­
tive relationships. 
It is not clear why relationships have such an effect on these individuals. 
A number of faaors may be important. It is not difficult to imagine how so­
cial leaming can account for this phenomenon. If a child is reinforced for 
being competent and happy when around people and is sent to be alone when 
aaing otherwise, it seems reasonable that the child may learn competence 
and happiness when with people. For an individual who is deficient in self-
regulation and therefore relies on regulation from the environment, being alone 
may become fraught with danger. The anxiety that results from not having 
access to a helping relationship may disrupt the person's affea sufficiently 
to start the negative affea cycle that eventually interferes with competent be­
havior. In addition, the weU-known phenomenon of performance facilitation 
in the presence of other individuals (Zajonc, 1965) may simply be more po­
tent with borderline patients. 
The appearance of competence can fool others, including the therapist, 
into believing that the borderline individual is more competent than she ac­
tually is. The discrepancy between appearance and aauality simply perpetu­
ates the invalidating environment. The absence of expeaed competence is 
attributed to lack of motivation, "not trying," playing games, manipulations, 
or other faaors discrepant with the individual's phenomenal experience. Thus, 
--- Page 103 ---
84 THEORY AND CONCEPTS 
a major consequence of this borderline syndrome is that it supports the ther­
apist and others in "blaming the viaim" and blinds them to the patient's need 
for assistance in learning new behavioral pattems. 
The Dialectical Dilemma for the Patient 
The borderline individual is faced with an apparendy irreconcilable dilem­
ma. On the one hand, she has tremendous difficulties with self-regulation 
of affea and subsequent behavioral competence. She frequently but some­
what unprediaably needs a great deal of assistance, often feels helpless and 
hopeless, and is afraid of being left alone to fend for herself in a world where 
she has failed over and over again. Without the ability to predict and control 
her own weU-being, she depends on her social environment to regulate her 
affea and behavior. On the other hand, she experiences intense shame at be­
having dependently in a society that cannot tolerate dependency, and has 
learned to inhibit expressions of negative affect and helplessness whenever 
the affect is within controllable limits. Indeed, when in a positive mood, she 
may be exceptionally competent across a variety of situations. However, in 
the positive mood state she has difficulty prediaing her own behavioral capa­
bilities in a different mood, and thus communicates to others an ability to 
cope beyond her capabilities. Thus, the borderline individual, even though 
at times desperate for help, has great difficulty asking for help appropriately 
or communicating her needs. 
The inability to integrate or synthesize the notions of helplessness and 
competence, of noncontrol and control, and of needing and not needing help 
can lead to further emotional distress and dysfunaional behaviors. Believing 
that she is competent to "succeed," the person may experience intense guilt 
about her presumed lack of motivation when she falls short of objeaives. 
At other times, she experiences extreme anger at others for their lack of un­
derstanding and unrealistic expeaations. Both the intense guilt and the in­
tense anger can lead to dysfunaional behaviors, including suicide and 
parasuicide, aimed at reducing the painful emotional states. For the appar­
ently competent person, suicidal behavior is sometimes the only means of 
communicating to others that she reaUy can't cope and needs help; that is, 
suicidal behavior is a cry for help. The behavior may also funaion as a means 
to get others to alter their unrealistic expeaations—to "prove" to the world 
that she really cannot do what is expeaed. 
The Dialectical Dilemma for the Therapist 
The dimension of active passivity versus apparent competence presents a di­
alectical challenge for the therapist as well. A therapist who sees only the 
competence of the apparentiy competent person not only may be too demand­
ing in terms of performance expeaations, but may also be unresponsive to 
low-level communications of distress and difficulty. An invalidating environ-
--- Page 104 ---
Behavioral Patterns: Dialectical Dilemmas 85 
ment ensues. The tendency to attribute lack of progress to "resistance" rather 
than inability is especially dangerous. Not only is such a stance, adopted un­
critically, invaHdating; it also prevents the therapist from offering needed skills 
training. The all-too-usual experience of a patient's leaving a session appar­
ently in a neutral or even positive emotional state, but caUing shortly, there­
after to threaten suicide, may be a consequence of this pattern. 
In contrast, it can be an equal problem if a therapist does not recognize 
a patient's true capacities, thus falling into the aaive-passivity pattern with 
her. It can be especially easy for the therapist to mistake escalating emotion­
ality and demands for true deficiencies. Panic at times masquerades as in­
ability. Naturally, it can be especially difficult to avoid this trap when the 
patient is insisting that if therapeutic expectations are not lowered and more 
assistance given, suicide will be the consequence. It takes a courageous (and, 
I might add, self-confident) therapist to avoid caving in and appeasing the 
patient under these circumstances. Behavioral principles of response shaping 
are especially relevant in these situations. For example, as I discuss further 
in Chapter 8, in the early stages of treatment the therapist may need to "mind-
read" the patient's emotions more often from skimpy information and antici­
pate problems much more than during later stages, after the patient has im­
proved her communications skills. The key, of course, is accurately judging 
where on the shaping gradient the patient is at a particular moment. 
Breaking through the active passivity and generating coparticipation is 
a continuing task. The mistake the therapist must avoid is that of continuing 
the oversimplification of the patient's difficulties and assuming too soon that 
the patient can cope with problems alone. Such an assumption is understand­
able, given the apparent-competence pattern. However, such a mistake sim­
ply increases the passivity of the patient; otherwise, the patient risks going 
out on a limb and being left alone to climb down. In general, the easier the 
therapist makes progress sound, the more passive the individual is likely to 
be. But stressing the inherent difficulty of change, while at the same time re­
quiring active progress nonetheless, can facilitate aaive work. The role of the 
therapist is to balance the patient's capabilities and deficiencies, once again 
flexibly altemating between supportive-acceptance and confrontational/change 
approaches to treatment. Exhortations to change must be integrated with in­
finite patience. 
Unrelenting Crises versus Inhibited Grieving 
Unrelenting Crises 
Many borderline and suicidal individuals are in a state of perpetual, unrelent­
ing crisis. Although suicide, parasuicide, and most other dysfunctional be­
haviors are conceptualized in DBT as maladaptive attempts at solvmg problems 
in living, a more accurate statement is that these behaviors are responses to 
a state of chronic, overwhelming crisis. This state is debilitating to the bor-
--- Page 105 ---
86 THEORY AND CONCEPTS 
derline individual not because of the magnitude of any one stressful event, 
but because of both the individual's high reaaivity and the chronic nature 
of the stressful events. For example, simultaneous loss of job, spouse, and 
children and a concomitant serious illness would —theoreticaUy, at least—be 
easier to cope with than the same set of events experienced on a sequential 
basis. Berent (1981) suggests that repetitive stressful events, coupled with an 
inability to recover fully from any one stressful event, result in "weakening 
of the spirit" and subsequent suicidal or other "emergency" behaviors. In a 
sense, the patient can never return to an emotional baseline before the next 
blow hits. From Selye's (1956) point of view, the individual is constantly ap­
proaching the "exhaustion" stage of stress adaptation. 
This inability to return to baseline may be a result of several faaors. Typi­
cally, a borderline individual both creates and is controlled by an aversive en­
vironment. Temperamental faaors exacerbate the individual's initial emotional 
response and rate of return to baseline after each stressor. Both the magni­
tude and number of subsequent stressors are then increased by the individu­
al's responses to the initial sttessor. An inability to tolerate or reduce short-term 
stress without emitting dysfunaional escape behaviors aeates still more stres­
sors. Inadequate interpersonal skills both result in interpersonal stress and 
preclude solving many of life's problems. An equally inadequate social sup­
port network (the invalidating environment) may contribute to the inability 
to control negative environmental events; it also further weakens the person's 
chances to develop needed capabilities. 
For example, a woman may be controlled by an abusive husband and 
several young, dependent children. It may be unrealistic, either financially 
or morally, to suggest that she leave her family. Poor skills and a deficient 
social support network may exacerbate her inability to control negative en­
vironmental events, in addition to preventing her from developing any new 
skills or strengths. Another woman may be in a job environment that offers 
few rewards and many punishments; it may be economically impossible, how­
ever, for her to leave the job in the foreseeable future. Long working hours may 
interfere with any chance she might have to learn the skills that would make 
a better job possible. The resulting chronic, unrelenting sttess, combined wdth 
an initial low tolerance for stressful events and an inability to avoid them, 
leads almost inevitably to the experience of further events as overwhelming. 
This experience of being overwhelmed is often the key to understanding 
borderline patients' repetitive tendency (sometimes almost determination) to 
commit parasuicidal aas, threaten suicide, or engage in other impulsive, dys­
functional behaviors. And, as Berent (1981) suggests, the cumulative weatening 
of the spirit can lead to actual completed suicide. Seemingly incomprehens­
ible overreactions to apparentiy minor events, criticisms, and losses become 
understandable when viewed against the backdrop of the patients' helpless­
ness in the face of the chronic crises they experience. The aaive-passivity pat­
tern, described above, suggests that these individuals are usually unable to 
reduce the stress unaided. Both patterns —unrelenting crises and active pas-

sivity—predict the frequent, excessive demands that these patients make on 
therapists. However, the apparent-competence pattern leads to a certain un-
wilHngness on the part of others to assist the patients. When this unwilling­
ness extends even to their therapists, situations can escalate still more rapidly 
into unendurable crises. 
Unremitting crises generally interfere with treatment planning. Critical 
problems change faster than either a patient or a therapist can deal with ef­
fectively. In my experience, the crisis-oriented nature of the borderline individu­
al's life makes it particularly difficult—indeed, almost impossible—to follow 
a predetermined behavioral treatment plan. This is especially so if the plan 
involves teaching skills that are not intimately and obviously related to the 
current crisis and that do not promise immediate relief. Focused skills train­
ing with the borderline patient is a bit like trying to teach an individual how 
to build a house that will not fall down in a tornado, just as a tornado hits. 
The patient knows that the appropriate place to be during a tornado is in 
the basement, crouching under a sturdy table; it is understandable if she in­
sists on waiting out an emotional "tornado" in the "basement." 
I spent many years trying to get myself to apply consistently to chroni­
cally parasuicidal and borderline patients the behavioral therapies I knew to 
be effeaive with other patient populations. Generally, these treatment strate­
gies required a consistent focus on some sort of skiUs training, exposure, cog­
nitive restruauring, or self-management training. But I simply could not get 
myself or the patients to stick to my well-thought-out and articulated treat­
ment plans for more than a week or two. In the face of new and multiple 
crises, I was constantly reanalyzing the problems, redeveloping the treatment 
plans, or simply taking time out from the current treatment to attend to the 
crises. New problems always seemed more important than old problems. Most 
of the time, I attributed my inability to get the therapy to work to my own 
inexperience as a behavior therapist or some other therapeutic weakness on 
my part. After a number of years, however, I decided that even if the problems 
were my lack of ability, there were probably many other therapists as unskilled 
as I. This insight was instrumental in my developing DBT. The solution to 
this dilemma in DBT has been to develop psychoeducational therapy mod­
ules to teach specific behavioral, cognitive, and emotional skills. Although 
the task of individual psychotherapy is to help the patient integrate the skills 
into daily life, the rudiments of the skills are taught outside of the context 
of ordinary individual therapy. My colleagues and I have found that it is far 
easier for a therapist to resist being pulled into individual crises in a group 
setting. In addition, it seems easier for patients to understand and tolerate 
a seeming absence of attention to their individual crises when they can at­
tribute this to demands of the group setting rather than to lack of concern 
for their current helplessness; the sense of personal invalidation is reduced. 
A group is not essential, however. Any setting where the context is different 
from that of standard individual therapy-where the message conveyed is "Now 
we are doing skills training, not crisis intervention"—may work as well. 
--- Page 107 ---
88 THEORY AND CONCEPTS 
A further therapeutic problem with unrelenting crises is that it is often 
easy for both a patient and a therapist to get lost in the thicket of the crises. 
Once the patient is emotionally out of control, her crises can escalate and 
become so complex that neither patient nor therapist can maintain a focus 
on the original precipitating event or problem. Part of the problem at times 
is the patient's tendency to ruminate about traumatic events. The rumination 
not only perpetuates the crises, but can generate new crises whose relation­
ship to the original crises is often overlooked. Such a patient is a bit Hke an 
overtired child on a family outing. Once overtired, the child may become up­
set at every minor frustration and disagreement, crying and having tantrums 
at the slightest provocation. If the parents focus on trying to resolve every 
individual crisis, little progress will be made. It is far better to attend to the 
original problem—lack of sleep and rest. Similarly, the therapist with a bor­
derline patients must be attentive to the original event creating emotional vul­
nerability in a particular sequence or chain; otherwise, the therapist may soon 
be so distracted by the patient's accumulating distress that he or she becomes 
confused and disorganized in approaching the problem. 
One patient of mine, whom I will call Lorie, was particularly sensitive 
to criticism and disapproval. She had been brought up in a home with an 
abusive father who could not control his temper. When the children did any­
thing he disapproved of, violent outbursts sometimes followed, frequently ac­
companied by beatings. By the time Lorie was 35, a typical scenario would 
be as follows: She would make a decision and put into effea a plan she later 
feared her supervisor at work might not like. After much ruminating about 
the decision and her supervisor's likely negative reaction, she would retreat 
from the plan, deciding that her original decision was wrong. She would then 
fret over her apparent stupidity or problematic cognitive style. She might then 
have a discussion with other colleagues and decide that a joint work project, 
unrelated to the area of concern with her supervisor, was hopeless because 
of her cognitive impairment. After work she would buy liquor, go home to her 
room, and get drunk, rationalizing that she already had brain damage anyway. 
She would thereby disappoint her husband, who was near the end of his rope 
over her drinking. The next morning, with a hangover and unavoidable guilt 
about turning to alcohol again, she might overreaa to a question from her hus­
band about a college tuition bill for her daughter, and a heated argument with 
her husband over finances would ensue. She would then come to a session that 
day with me and begin with a calm request to discuss whether she should look 
for another job or sell her house, because she had decided that her family 
needed a higher income to put her children through college. All of my attempts 
at problem solving in regard to this particular crisis (not enough college 
money) would, understandably, be met by further escalation of emotion. 
Inhibited Grieving 
Balancing the tendency to perpetual crisis is the corresponding tendency to

avoid or inhibit the experience and expression of extreme, painful emotional 
reaaions. "Inhibited grieving" refers to a pattem of repetitive, significant trau­
ma and loss, together with an inability to fully experience and personally 
integrate or resolve these events. A crisis of any type always involves some 
form of loss. The loss can be concrete (e.g., loss of a person through death, 
loss of money or job, or loss of a relationship through breakup or divorce). 
The loss can be primarily psychological (e.g., loss of prediaability and con­
trol because of sudden, unexpected environmental changes, or loss of hope 
of ever having nurturing parents when a person once again recognizes their 
Hmitations). Or the loss can be perceptual (e.g., perceived loss of interper­
sonal acceptance when another's remark is interpreted as critical). The ac­
cumulation of such losses can have two effects. First, significant early or 
unexpeaed loss may result in sensitization to later loss (Brasted & Callahan, 
1984; Osterweis, Solomon, & Green, 1984; Callahan, Brasted, & Granados, 
1983; Parkes, 1964). Second, a pattern of many losses leads to "bereavement 
overload," to use a term coined by Kastenbaum (1969). It is as if the process 
of grieving itself is inhibited. As my description of this pattern indicates, in­
hibited grieving overlaps considerably with posttraumatic stress disorder. 
Both BPD and parasuicidal behavior are associated with a history of one 
or more major losses (incest, physical or other sexual abuse, death of a par­
ent or sibling, parental neglect) at an early age. A number of empirical litera­
ture reviews (Gunderson & Zanarini, 1989) have concluded that borderline 
patients experience more childhood loss of a parent through divorce or death, 
higher rates of early childhood separation from primary caretakers, and more 
physical abuse and neglea than do other types of psychiatric patients. As I 
have discussed in describing the invalidating environment (Chapter 2) most 
striking is the strong relationship of BPD with histories of childhood sexual 
abuse. These data on childhood trauma have led at least one investigator to 
suggest that BPD is a specialized case of posttraumatic stress disorder (Ross, 
1989). 
Normal Grieving 
The empirical research on normal grieving is meager and generally focuses 
on the sequelae of deaths of loved ones. However, normal grief has a number 
of identifiable stages: (1) avoidance, including disbelief, numbness, or shock; 
(2) developing awareness of the loss, leading to acute mourning, which may 
include yeaming and searching for the thing lost, various painful physical sen­
sations and emotional responses, preoccupation with images and thoughts 
of the lost object, behavioral and cognitive disorganization, and despair; and 
(3) resolution, reorganization, and acceptance (see Rando, 1984, for a review 
of various formulations of the grief process). Grief is an exceptionally pain­
ful process consisting of a variety of charaaeristic emotional, physical, cog­
nitive, and behavioral responses. Although not all responses typify each 
grieving individual, the following charaaeristics are sufficiently common to 
--- Page 109 ---
90 THEORY AND CONCEPTS 
be considered part of "normal grief when they do occur: hollowness of 
stomach, tightness of throat or chest, difficulty in swallowing, breathlessness, 
muscle weakness, lack of energy, dryness of mouth, dizziness, fainting spells, 
nightmares, insomnia, blurred vision, skin rashes, sweating, appetite distur­
bance, indigestion, vomiting, palpitations, menstrual disturbance, headache, 
general aching, depersonalization, haUucinations, and intense negative emo­
tions (Worden, 1982; Maddison & Viola, 1968; Rees, 1975). It is important 
to note here that grief and the process of grieving include the full array of 
negative emotions—sadness, guilt and self-reproach, anxiety and fear, lone­
liness, and anger. 
All social animals, including humans, mourn loss to one degree or 
another—a phenomenon with probable survival value for the species (Averill, 
1968). Although there is a substantial clinical lore about the necessity of 
mourning, working through, and resolving loss, there is very little research 
to back up most claims about the process. Wortman and Silver (1989) sug­
gest that there are at least three common patterns of adaptation to loss. Some 
individuals go through the expected pattern as described above. A sizeable 
minority enter into the mourning phase and continue in a state of high dis­
tress for much longer than would be expected. Finally, others do not show 
intense distress following loss, either immediately after the loss or at subse­
quent intervals. That, is some individuals appear to adaptively circumvent 
the grieving process. 
Problems wi^ Grieving in Borderline Patients 
Borderline patients are not among those able to circumvent the process of 
grieving. Furthermore, they seem unable either to tolerate or to move through 
the acute mourning phase. Instead of progressing through the grief process 
to resolution and acceptance, they continually resort to one or more avoidance 
responses. Thus, the inhibition of grieving among borderline individuals serves 
to exacerbate the effect of stressful events and continues a vicious cycle. 
Inhibited grieving is understandable among borderline patients. People 
can only stay with a very painful process or experience if they are confident 
that it will end some day, some time —that they can "work through it," so 
to speak. It is not uncommon to hear borderline patients say they feel that 
if they ever do cry, they will never stop. Indeed, that is their common 
experience —the experience of not being able to control or modulate their 
own emotional experiences. They become, in effect, grief-phobic. In the face 
of such helplessness and lack of control, inhibition and avoidance of cues 
associated with grieving are not only understandable, but perhaps wise at 
times. Inhibition, however, has its costs. 
The common theme in pathological grieving is successful avoidance of 
cues related to the loss (Callahan & Burnette, 1989). The ability to avoid 
all cues associated with repeated losses, however is limited. Therefore, bor­
derline individuals are constantly re-exposed to the experience of loss, start 
--- Page 110 ---
Behavioral Patterns: Dialectical Dilemmas 91 
the mourning process, automatically inhibit the process by avoiding or dis­
tracting themselves from the relevant cues, re-enter the process, and so on 
in a circular pattern that does not end. Exposure to the cues associated with 
their losses and grief is never sustained long enough for desensitization to 
be achieved. Gauthier and Marshall (1977) have suggested that such brief ex­
posure to intensive stimuli may create a situation analogous to the "Napalkov 
phenomenon." Napalkov (1963) found that following a single pairing of a 
conditioned stimulus and an aversive unconditioned stimulus, repeated brief 
presentations of the conditioned stimulus alone at full intensity produced a 
marked increase in a conditioned blood pressure response. Eysenck (1967, 
1968) has elaborated this into a theory of the cognitive incubation of fear 
in humans. As Gauthier and Marshall (1977) point out, intrusive thoughts 
about one's loss or trauma, followed by attempts to suppress such thoughts, 
match the conditions described by Eysenck as ideal for the incubation of dis­
tressed responses. 
Volkan (1983) describes an interesting phenomenon, "established patho­
logical mourning," which is similar to the pattern I am describing. In estab­
lished pathological mourning, the individual wishes to complete mourning, 
but at the same time persistently attempts to undo the reality of the loss. I 
have seen this pattem repeatedly in patients whose previous therapists precipi­
tously terminated therapy with them. One of my patients was put in a hospi­
tal following a suicide attempt. Her therapist visited her in the hospital and 
informed her that therapy was over and there would be no further contact 
between them. Thereafter, this therapist consistently refused any contact with 
the patient, did not respond to any attempts at communication, and refused 
even to talk with me or send me a report, suggesting that such contact would 
only reopen hope on the part of the patient. The first 2 years of therapy with 
me consisted of the patient's continually trying to re-establish contaa with 
her previous therapist, often by trying to persuade me to set up a joint meet­
ing; expressing anger at me whenever I aaed in ways inconsistent with the 
way her previous therapist had worked; continually entering into the griev­
ing process with components of somatic, emotional, cognitive, and behavioral 
grief responses, including suicidal behaviors; and eventually short-circuiting 
the mourning response by returning to efforts to re-establish contact. 
Although we know that long-term inhibition of grief is detrimental, it 
is not particularly clear why the expression of emotions associated with loss 
and trauma is beneficial. It may be that exposure to cues associated with emo­
tional pain leads to extinction or habituation, whereas constant avoidance 
and insufficient exposure interfere with these processes. There is some evi­
dence that talking or writing about traumatic or stressful events, especially 
when the disclosure includes the emotions aroused by the event, leads to 
reduced ruminating about the event, improved physical health, and increased 
feelings of well-being (see Pennebaker, 1988, for a review of this work). 
The task of the therapist with a borderline patient is helping the patient 
to encounter the losses and traumatic events in her life and to experience and 
--- Page 111 ---
92 THEORY AND CONCEPTS 
express grief reactions. The principal way of achieving this is to discuss 
the situations during therapy sessions. This is easier said than done, since 
often the patient aaively resists such suggestions. Some patients insist on dis­
cussing previous traumas, particularly childhood abuse, before they are able 
to reverse the associated emotional inhibition. Even when the therapist is suc­
cessful at beginning discussion of a trauma or loss, the patient will often simply 
shut down in the middle and be silent or only minimally communicative. For 
example, I have rarely had a patient who will continue talking about a topic 
if she feels that she is going to cry; the threat of tears generally stops our 
interaaion until the patient regains control. One of my patients, whom I will 
call Jane, could almost never discuss emotionally charged topics for more than 
a minute or two. Almost immediately, her jaw and facial muscles would tight­
en, she would look away or curl up in a fetal position, and all interaaions 
would cease. With previous therapists, who themselves fell silent when Jane 
did, she sometimes went for whole sessions without saying a word. Over time, 
I learned that during such episodes her mind usually either went blank or 
was flooded with racing thoughts; she felt as if she were choking, couldn't 
get her breath, and believed she might be dying. 
Once confrontation and urging the patient to talk do not work, the ther­
apist may be tempted to assume that since the experience is frustrating for 
him or her, the patient must luant to be frustrating. The patient's behavior 
is then interpreted as an attack on the therapist or the therapy, as I have 
described earlier in this chapter in the discussion of anger and BPD. (The 
videotape of a therapy session with Jane, as noted in that discussion, is one 
of those that causes some professionals in the audience to assume that the 
frequent silences during the session are aaive attempts to attack me.) Often, 
my interpretation of such behavior as inhibited grief has been interpreted as 
naivete on my part. Sometimes it seems to me that therapists think their own 
frustration and anger are infallible guides to the motives of the patient. The 
danger in such an approach is that it clearly invalidates the experience of the 
patient; thus, it perpetuates the invalidating environment that the patient has 
been exposed to all her life. Furthermore, it fails to offer the patient the help 
she needs. 
In my experience, a more fruitful approach has been to focus on specific 
and concrete behaviors in which the patient can engage to reverse the emo­
tional inhibition. The idea is to take the patient's expressive difficulty seri­
ously and offer the help she needs. For example, with Jane, I progressed from 
specific instructions to remove mirrored sunglasses or unwrap her arms from 
around her knees to sessions where, when observing her jaw tightening, I 
reminded her to relax her face muscles and drop her jaw slightly. One can 
take this point of view to an extreme, however, and refuse to assess for hostile 
motivation and anger when it exists. The key point is that factors influencing 
behavior must be subject to assessment, not assumptions. The inhibited-
grieving pattern offers an alternative to analyses of patients' sometimes con­
trary behaviors as manifestations of hostility directed at the therapist.

Behavioral Patterns: Dialectical Dilemmas 93 
The Dialectical Dilemma for the Patient 
The borderline patient is actually presented with two dilemmas on the dimen­
sion of unrelenting crises versus inhibited grieving. First, it is difficult if not 
impossible for her to inhibit grief reactions on demand and avoid exposure 
to loss and trauma cues when at the same time she is in a state of perpetual 
crisis. Second, although inhibition of affeaive responses associated with grief 
may be effective for short-term resolution of pain, it is not very effective in 
bringing about social support for the patient's crises, nor does it lead to tran­
quillity in the long run. Indeed, the escape behaviors typical of inhibited griev­
ing are often impulsive behaviors such as drinking, driving fast, spending 
money, engaging in unprotected sex, and leaving situations. These behaviors 
are instrumental in creating new crises. Thus, the borderline individual tends 
to vacillate back and forth between the two extremes: At one moment, she 
is vulnerable to the crises; at the next, she inhibits all affective experiences 
associated with the crises. The key problem is that as the experience at each 
extreme intensifies, it becomes increasingly hard for the patient not to jump 
to the other extreme. 
The Dialectical Dilemma for the Therapist 
The dialectical dilemma for the therapist is to balance his or her response 
to the oscillating nature of the patient's distress—sometimes expressed as acute 
crises and overwhelming affect, and at other times presenting as complete 
inhibition of affective responding. An intense reaction by the therapist at either 
extreme may be all that is needed to push the patient to the other extreme. 
The task of the therapist is, first to help the patient understand her reaction 
patterns, and, second, to offer realistic hope that the patient can indeed sur­
vive the process of grieving. Such realistic hope requires the therapist to teach 
grieving skills, including the coping strategies needed for successful accep­
tance and reorganization of life in the present without that which is lost. 
Concurrently, the therapist must also validate and support the patient's 
emotional experience and difficulties in the unrelenting crises of her life. Offer­
ing understanding without concrete help in ameliorating crises, of course, may 
be even more distressing than offering nothing at all. Yet the concrete help 
that the therapist has to offer requires the patient to confront rather than avoid 
the crises she is experiencing. The synthesis toward which the therapist works 
in the patient is the ability both to grieve deeply and to end grieving; the ulti­
mate goal is for the patient to build and rebuild her life in the light of the 
current realities. 
Concluding Comments 
In this chapter, as well as the previous two, I have described the theoretical 
foundations of DBT. It is easy for many to believe that theory is not very rele-

vant to practice. Practical help, especially ideas of what to do and when to 
do it, is what many therapists want and need. The rest of this book is an 
attempt to provide you with just such help —to take the theory and make it 
practical. However, no therapy manual or book can anticipate all of the situ­
ations you will run into. Thus, you will need to know the theory well enough 
to be able to create a new therapy with each patient. The purpose of theory 
is to give you a short-hand way to think about the patient—a way to under­
stand her experience and to relate to it, even though you may not have ex­
perienced similar problems yourself. It is also intended to provide a 
conceptualization of the patient's difficulties that will give you hope when 
you are feeling hopeless, and to provide an avenue for new treatment ideas 
when you are desperate for something different to try. 
Notes 
1. Otto Kernberg is one of the most influential theorists proposing excess anger 
as crucial in the development of BPD. When I proposed this gender-linked hypothesis 
to account for our differences on this point, he pointed out that many of his teachers 
have been women. 
2. At other times, expressive inhibition may function as an emotional control 
strategy. An alternate explanation for the "apparent nonemotionality" of some bor­
derline patients may be that reduced nonverbal emotional expressiveness in general, 
or at certain levels of arousal, or for certain emotions, is a result of constitutional 
(i.e., biological) factors. If this is the case, it might be an important factor in eliciting 
invalidation from the environment at an early age.

Overview of Treatment-
Targets, Strategies, and 
Assumptions in a Nutshell 
Crucial Steps in Treatment 
In a nutshell, DBT is very simple. The therapist creates a context of validat­
ing rather than blaming the patient, and within that context the therapist 
blocks or extinguishes bad behaviors, drags good behaviors out of the pa­
tient, and figures out a way to make the good behaviors so reinforcing that 
the patient continues the good ones and stops the bad ones.' 
At the onset, "bad" and "good" behaviors are defined and listed in order 
of importance. Commitment (even if only half-hearted) to work on the DBT 
behavioral targets is a requisite characteristic of the DBT patient. The requi­
site characteristics of the therapist are compassion, persistence, patience, a 
belief in the efficacy of the therapy that will outlast the patient's belief in its 
inefficacy, and a certain willingness to play "chicken" and take risks. Accom­
plishing these tasks requires a number of steps, which are discussed below. 
Setting the Stage: Getting the Patient's Attention 
Agreeing on Goals and Orienting the Patient to Treatment 
Agreement on goals of treatment and general treatment procedures is the cru­
cial first step before therapy even begins. At this point, the therapist has to 
get the patient's attention and interest. DBT is very specific on the order and 
importance of various treatment targets, as Chapter 5 discusses in detail. Sui­
cidal, parasuicidal, and life-threatening behaviors are first. Behaviors that 
threaten the process of the therapy are second. Problems that make it impos­
sible ever to develop a reasonable quality of life are third in importance. 
97 
--- Page 117 ---
98 TREATMENT OVERVIEW AND GOALS 
Throughout treatment, the patient is learning coping skills to use instead of 
habitual, dysfunctional responses; fourth most important is the stabilization 
of these behavioral skills. Once progress has been made on these goals, work 
on resolving posttraumatic stress rises to the top in importance, followed by 
helping the patient achieve broad-based self-validation and self-respect. 
Patients who do not agree to work on decreasing suicidal and parasuici­
dal behaviors and interpersonal styles that interfere with therapy, as well as 
on increasing behavioral skills, are not accepted into treatment. (Agreements 
to work on other DBT targets are developed as therapy progresses.) Prospec­
tive patients are then oriented to other aspects of the treatment, including 
the ways in which treatment is carried out and any ground rules. Patients who 
do not agree to the minimum ground rules (described later in this chapter) 
are not accepted. In settings where patients cannot legally or ethically be re­
jected from treatment, some sort of special "program within a program" is 
needed so that patients can be rejeaed. Patients' agreements to the terms of 
DBT are always brought up when they later try to violate the rules or get 
the rules changed. Therapists' agreements can also legitimately be brought 
up by the patients. 
Establishing a Relationship 
The therapist must work to establish a strong, positive interpersonal rela­
tionship with the patient right from the beginning. This is essential because 
the relationship with the therapist is frequently the only reinforcer that works 
for a borderline individual in managing and changing behavior. With a high­
ly suicidal patient, the relationship with the therapist is at times what keeps 
her alive when all else fails. Finally, similar to many schools of psychothera­
py, DBT works on the premise that the experience of being genuinely accepted 
and cared for and about is of value in its own right, apart from any changes 
that the patient makes as a result of therapy (Linehan, 1989). Not much in 
DBT can be done before this relationship is developed. 
As soon as the relationship is established, the therapist begins to com­
municate to the patient that the mles have changed. Whereas the patient might 
have believed previously that if she got better she would lose the therapist, 
she is now told that if she does not improve she will lose the therapist much 
more quickly: "Continuing an ineffective therapy is unethical." DBT has been 
called "blackmail therapy" by some, since the therapist is willing to put the 
quality of the relationship on the line in a trade for improved behavior on 
the part of the patient. If the therapist cannot achieve the interpersonal pow­
er necessary to influence change, then the therapy should be expanded to in­
clude those who do have such power with the patient. For example, with 
adolescents, family therapy may be essential. 
Staying Dialectical 
The central dialeaical tension in DBT is that between change and acceptance. 
--- Page 118 ---
Overview of Treatment 99 
The paradoxical notion here is that therapeutic change can only occur in the 
context of acceptance of what is; however, "acceptance of what is" is itself 
change. DBT therefore requires that the therapist balance change and accep­
tance in each interaction with the patient. DBT treatment strategies can be 
organized in terms of their tendencies to fall primarily at the change end ver­
sus the acceptance end of the dialectical polarity. The secondary tension is 
between the exercises of control and freeing. The therapist exerts control of 
the therapy (and at times the patient) to enhance the patient's ultimate free­
dom and self-control. Staying dialeaical also requires that the therapist model 
and reinforce dialeaical response styles. Behavioral extremes (whether emo­
tional, cognitive, or overt responses) are confronted, and new, more balanced 
responses are taught. 
Applying Core Strategies: Validation and Problem Solving 
The core of the treatment is the application of problem-solving strategies 
balanced by validation strategies. This is the "teeter-totter" on which the ther­
apy rests. From the patient's perspeaive, maladaptive behaviors are often the 
solutions to problems she wants solved or taken away. From the DBT ther­
apist's perspeaive, however, maladaptive behaviors are themselves the 
problems to be solved. 
Validation 
There are two types of validation. In the first type, the therapist finds the 
wisdom, correaness, or value in the individual's emotional, cognitive, and 
overt behavioral responses. The important focus here is the search for those 
behavioral responses, parts of responses, and patterns that are valid in the 
context of current, associated events. A key function of emotional suffering 
and maladaptive behaviors for borderline patients is self-validation. Thus, 
therapeutic changes cannot be made unless another source of self-validation 
is developed. A treatment focused only on changing the patient invalidates 
the patient. The second type of validation has to do with the therapist's ob­
serving and believing in the patient's inherent ability to get out of the misery 
that is her life and build a life worth living. In DBT, the therapist finds and 
plays to the patient's strengths, not to her fragility. The therapist both be­
lieves and believes in the patient. 
Problem Solving 
The core change strategies are those that fall under the rubric of problem 
solving. This set of strategies includes a (1) performing a behavioral analysis 
of the targeted behavior problem; (2) performing a solution analysis, in which 
altemate behavioral solutions are developed; (3) orienting the patient to the 
proposed treatment solution; (4) eliciting a commitment from the patient to 
--- Page 119 ---
100 TREATMENT OVERVIEW AND GOALS 
engage in the recommended treatment procedures; and (5) appling the 
treatment. 
A behavioral analysis consists of a moment-to-moment chain analysis 
to determine events that elicit or prompt maladaptive behavior, as well as a 
functional analysis to determine probable reinforcing contingencies for 
maladaptive behaviors. The process and outcome of the behavioral analysis 
lead into the solution analysis: The therapist and (optimally) the patient gener­
ate alternate behavioral responses and develop a treatment plan oriented to 
changing targeted behavior problems. Four questions are addressed: 
1. Does the individual have the capability to engage in more adaptive 
responses and to construct a life worth living? If not, what behavioral skills 
are needed? The answers to this question leads to the focus on skills training 
procedures. Five sets of skills are emphasized: "core" mindfulness skills, dis­
tress tolerance, emotion regulation, interpersonal effectiveness, and self-
management. (Chapter 5 discusses these in more detail.) 
2. What are the reinforcement contingencies? Is the problem a result of 
reinforcing outcomes for maladaptive behaviors, or of punishing or neutral 
outcomes for adaptive behaviors? If either is the case, contingency manage­
ment procedures are developed. The goal here is to arrange for positive be­
haviors to be reinforced, for negative behaviors to be punished or extinguished, 
and for the patient to learn the new rules. 
3. If adaptive problem-solving behaviors exist, is their application in­
hibited by excessive fear or guilt? Is the patient emotion-phobic? If so, an 
exposure-based treatment is instituted. 
4. If adaptive problem-solving behaviors exist, is their application in­
hibited or interfered with by faulty beliefs and assumptions? If so, a cognitive 
modification program must be instituted. 
In most cases, the behavioral analysis will show that there are skill deficits, 
problematic reinforcement contingencies, inhibitions resulting from fear and 
guilt, and faulty beliefs and assumptions. Thus, a treatment program integrat­
ing skill training, contingency management, exposure strategies, and cogni­
tive modification is likely to be required. The behavioral target of each strategy, 
however, is dependent on the behavioral analysis. 
Balancing Interpersonal Communication Styles 
DBT combines and balances two interpersonal communication styles: "irrever­
ent" and "reciprocal" communication. Irreverent communication is designed 
to get the patient to "jump the track," so to speak. The therapist's reactions 
are not obviously responsive to the patient's communications, are sometimes 
experienced as "off the wall," and involve the therapist's framing the issue un­
der consideration in a context different from the patient's. The main idea here 
is to push the patient "off balance" so that rebalancing can occur. The recipro-
--- Page 120 ---
Overview of Treatment 101 
cal communication style, in contrast, is warm, empathetic, and direcdy respon­
sive to the patient. It includes therapeutic self-disclosure designed to provide 
modeling of mastery and coping with problems, as well as of normative 
responses to everyday situations. 
Combining Consultation-to-the-Patient Strategies 
with Interventions in the Environment 
In DBT, there is a strong bias toward teaching the patient to be her own case 
manager (the "consultation-to-the-patient" approach). The basic notion here 
is that rather than intervening for the patient to solve problems or coordinate 
treatment with other professionals, the DBT therapist coaches the patient in 
how to resolve the problems herself. The approach flows directly out of the 
therapist's believing in the patient. Problems and inappropriate behavior on 
the part of other mental health professionals, even when they are members 
of the DBT treatment team, are viewed as opportunities for learning. The 
consultation-to-the-patient strategies are the dominant DBT case management 
strategies. Interventions in the environment to make changes, solve problems, 
or coordinate professional treatment on behalf of the patient are used instead 
of the consultation strategies and balance them when (1) the outcome is im­
portant and (2) the patient clearly does not have the capability to produce 
the outcome. 
Treating the Therapist 
Staying in a DBT frame can be extraordinarily difficult for the therapist with 
a borderline patient. An important part of DBT is the treatment of the ther­
apist by the supervision, case consultation, or treatment team. The role of 
the DBT case consultation group is to hold the therapist inside the treatment. 
The assumption is that treatment of borderline patients in solo practice, out­
side a team framework, is perilous at best. Thus, the treatment of the ther­
apist is integral to the therapy. 
Modes of Treatment 
I use the term "mode" to refer to the various treatment components that 
together make up DBT, as well as the manner of their delivery. In principle, 
DBT can be applied in any treatment mode. In our research program validat­
ing the effectiveness of DBT as an outpatient treatment, however, treatment 
was deHvered in four primary modes offered concurrently: individual psy­
chotherapy, group skills training, telephone consultation, and case consuka-
tion for therapists. In addition, most patients received one or more ancillary 
treatment modes. In different settings (e.g., solo private practice or inpatient 
treatment), these modes may need to be condensed or supplemented.

102 TREATMENT OVERVIEW AND GOALS 
Individual Outpatient Psychotherapy 
In "standard" DBT (i.e., the original version of DBT), each patient has an 
individual psychotherapist who is also the primary therapist for that patient 
on the tteatment team. All other modes of therapy revolve around the individu­
al therapy. The individual therapist is responsible for helping the patient in­
hibit maladaptive, borderline behaviors and replace them with adaptive, skillful 
responses. The individual therapist pays close attention to motivational is­
sues, including personal and environmental factors that inhibit effective be­
haviors and that elicit and reinforce maladaptive behaviors. 
Individual outpatient therapy sessions are usually held once a week. At 
the beginning of therapy and during crisis periods, sessions may be held twice 
a week; this is usually done only on a time-limited basis, although for some 
patients twice a week may be preferable. Sessions generally last from 50-60 
to 90-110 minutes. The longer sessions (i.e., "double sessions") are held with 
patients who have difficulty opening up and then closing up emotionally in 
the shorter sessions. Session length can vary over the treatment period, de­
pending on the specific therapy tasks to be accomplished. For example, ses­
sions may ordinarily last 60 minutes, but when exposure to abuse-related 
stimuli is planned, sessions may be scheduled for 90-120 minutes. Or one 
double session and one single session (or one half-session for "check-in") per 
week may be scheduled for a period of time. The therapist can shorten or 
lengthen a session on the spot to reinforce therapeutic "working" or to pun­
ish avoidance. When lengthening a session is impossible because of schedul­
ing conflicts, a phone consultation may be planned for that same evening, 
or a session may be scheduled for the next day. Alternatively, patients who 
often need somewhat longer sessions may be scheduled at the end of the day. 
The key idea here is that session length should be matched to the tasks at 
hand, not the mood of either the patient or the therapist. Creative problem 
solving on the part of the therapist is sometimes called for. 
Within clinic and research settings, assignment to therapists can pose 
special difficulties with borderline patients. Many borderline individuals have 
already had one or more "failed" therapeutic encounters and may have strong 
beliefs about what kind of person they want for a therapist. Therapists may 
have equally strong views about what kinds of patients they want to treat 
or feel comfortable with. Many women who have been sexually abused prefer 
to have a female therapist. In our clinic, my colleagues and I give information 
during the intake interview about the available therapists, and patients are 
asked for any preferences. A specific individual therapist is assigned follow­
ing the treatment team's review of each individual's intake interview, history, 
and presenting complaints. Although I support the idea of patients' and ther­
apists' interviewing each other to make an informed decision about working 
together, in our clinic such a procedure is not feasible. Instead, the first several 
sessions are structured as a way for each patient and therapist to decide 
whether they can indeed work together. A patient can switch therapists if 
--- Page 122 ---
Overview of Treatment 103 
she wishes to, if another one is available, and if that other therapist is willing 
to work with her. She may not participate in any other part of the treatment 
program, however, if she drops out of individual therapy without switching 
to another individual therapist (either inside or outside our clinic). 
Skills Training 
All patients must be in structured skiUs training during the first year of ther­
apy. In my experience, skills training with borderline patients is exceptional­
ly difficult within the context of individual therapy oriented to reducing the 
motivation for suicidal or other borderline behaviors. The need for crisis in­
tervention and attention to other issues generally precludes skiUs training. 
Nor can sufficient attention to motivational issues be easily given in a treat­
ment with the rigorous control of therapy agenda usually needed for skills 
training. The solution to this problem in standard DBT has been to split the 
therapy into two components; these are either conducted by different ther­
apists or applied in different modes by the same therapist. In our program, 
patients cannot be in skills training without concurrent individual psychother­
apy. The individual psychotherapy is necessary to help the patient integrate 
her new skills into daily life. The average borderline individual cannot replace 
dysfunaional, borderline coping styles with skilled behavioral coping without 
intensive individual coaching. 
DBT skills training is conducted in a psychoeducational format. In our 
program, it is generally conducted in open groups that meet weekly for 2 to 
IVz hours, but other group formats are possible. Some clinics have divided 
the group into two 1-hour sessions weekly (one session for homework review, 
one for presenting new material). In large clinics, there may be one lai^e group 
meeting per week for new skiU material, with numerous smaller weekly groups 
for homework review. In smaU clinics or private praaice, groups may be small 
and meet for shorter periods. 
Although my colleagues and I usually have six to eight members per 
group, a group needs only two patients. A patient who cannot be in a group 
for one reason or another, however, can be given skills training individually. 
In my experience, it is easier if a second therapist does the individual skills 
training; otherwise, there is a tendency (which I, at least, have difficulty resist­
ing) to faU into the individual, non-skills-training psychotherapy mode. If, 
instead, the individual therapist folds the skills training into the ongoing psy­
chotherapy, separate sessions tightly structured for skills training should be 
considered. 
A point-by-point skills training program is described in the companion 
manual to the present volume. 
Supportive Process Group Therapy 
After completing skills training, patients in my program can join optional 
supportive process group therapy if they wish. These groups are ongoing and 
--- Page 123 ---
104 TREATMENT OVERVIEW AND GOALS 
open; generally, patients make renewable, time-limited commitments to the 
group. To be in standard DBT supportive process groups, patients must have 
ongoing individual therapy or case management. The exceptions here are the 
most advanced groups, where group therapy may emerge as a long-term 
primary therapy for some borderline patients. The conduct of these groups 
is described more fully in the companion manual. 
Although I have not collected any empirical data on this question, it is 
conceivable that the individual DBT described above could be duplicated with­
in a group therapy context. In these cases, group DBT might supplement or 
replace the individual DBT component. 
Telephone Consultation 
Phone consultation with the individual outpatient therapist between psy­
chotherapy sessions is an important part of DBT. There are several reasons 
for this. First, many suicidal and borderline individuals have enormous 
difficulty asking for help effectively. Some are inhibited from asking for help 
directly by fear, shame, or beliefs that they are undeserving or their needs 
are invalid; they may instead engage in parasuicidal behavior or other crisis 
behaviors as a "cry for help." Other patients have no difficulty asking for help, 
but do so in a demanding or abusive manner, act in a way that makes poten­
tial benefaaors feel manipulated, or use other ineffective strategies. Telephone 
consultations are designed to provide practice in changing these dysfunction­
al patterns. Second, patients often need help in generalizing DBT behavioral 
skills to their everyday lives. Suicidal patients frequently need more therapeutic 
contact than can be provided in one individual session (and especially in one 
group skills training session) per week, especially during crises, when they 
may be unable to cope unassisted with problems in living. With a phone call, 
a patient can obtain the coaching needed for successful skill generalization 
to take place. Third, following conflict or misunderstandings, phone consul­
tation offers an avenue for patients to repair their sense of an intimate ther­
apeutic relationship without having to wait until the next session. 
In day treatment programs, inpatient units, and residential programs, in­
teractions with mental health technicians, nurses or other staff members can 
substitute for some of the phone consultations. In outpatient practice with 
an on-call system, other therapists can at times handle phone consultations 
within a DBT structure. This is particularly true for the first two goals of 
phone consultation (learning to ask for and receive help appropriately, and 
skiU generalization). 
Case Consultation Meetings for Therapists 
There is no question about it: Treating borderline patients is enormously stress­
ful for a therapist. Many therapists quickly burn out. Others (somewhat blind­
ly, I suspect) fall into iatrogenic behaviors. As subsequent sections of this 
--- Page 124 ---
Overview of Treatment 105 
chapter indicate, one assumption of DBT is that therapists often engage in 
the problematic behaviors of which patients accuse them. They may do so 
for good reasons. Borderline patients can put enormous pressure on their ther­
apists to ameliorate their pain immediately; therapists may thus feel pressured 
into making major (and at times precipitous) changes in the treatment, even 
when the treatment might have proved effective if held to. At other times, 
therapists reaa to such pressure by rigidly refusing to make any changes. When 
neither approach works and misery is not relieved, the therapists can easily 
respond by "blaming the victims." The stress of treating highly suicidal pa­
tients can lead to a cyclical pattern of appeasement followed by punitive reac­
tions followed by reconciliation, and so on. 
Problems that arise in a therapist's delivery of treatment are handled in 
DBT case consultation meetings. These meetings are attended by aU therapists 
(individual and group) currently utilizing DBT with borderline patients. Similar 
to the requirement that patients participate in skills training, DBT therapists 
are required to be in a consultation or supervision relationship; either with 
one other person or (my own preference) with a group. During the first year 
of therapy, both the group and the individual therapists should attend the 
same meetings. In agency, day treatment, or inpatient settings applying DBT, 
aU members of a patient's treatment team should attend the same meeting. 
Consultation meetings are held weekly. 
Ancillary Treatments 
Borderline patients may at times need more than the weekly individual, skills 
ttaining, and telephone sessions. For example, some may need pharmacother­
apy, day treatment, vocational counseling, or acute hospitalization, to name 
just a few. Many will also want to join nonprofessional groups such as Alco­
holics Anonymous. There is nothing in DBT that proscribes the patient from 
obtaining additional professional or nonprofessional treatments. 
If the additional treatment is offered by a therapist who regularly attends 
DBT consultation meetings and who applies DBT principles, then the DBT 
treatment is simply expanded to include these additional components. 
Although I have not written DBT protocols for these additional components, 
protocols based on DBT principles could (and should) be developed. For ex­
ample, DBT is currently being adapted for day treatment and for both acute 
and long-term inpatient programs (see Barley et al., in press). More commonly, 
the additional treatment components will be delivered by non-DBT therapists 
using principles derived from other theoretical traditions. Or, even when ad­
ditional treatment is applied by a DBT therapist, the therapist will not be 
able to consult regularly with the treatment team. In these cases the addi­
tional therapy is viewed as anciUary to the primary DBT treatment. There 
are specific protocols for the ancillary use of pharmacotherapy and acute psy­
chiatric hospitalizations; these are described in Chapter 15. Guidelines for 
how the DBT therapist interacts with ancillary health professionals are dis­
cussed in Chapter 13.

106 TREATMENT OVERVIEW AND GOALS 
Assumptions About Borderline Patients and Therapy 
The most important thing to remember about assumptions is that they are 
just that—assumptions, not facts. Nonetheless, assuming and acting on the 
propositions discussed below can be useful in treating borderline patients. 
They constitute the context for treatment planning. 
I. Patients Are Doing the Best They Can 
The first philosophical position in DBT is that all people are, at any given 
point in time, doing the best they can. In my experience, borderline patients 
are usually working desperately hard at changing themselves. Often, however, 
there is little visible success, nor are the patients' efforts at behavioral control 
particularly obvious much of the time. Because their behavior is frequently 
exasperating, inexplicable, and unmanageable, it is tempting to decide that 
the patients are not trying. At times, when asked about problematic behavior, 
the patients themselves will respond that they just weren't trying. Such pa­
tients have learned the social explanation for their behavioral failures. The 
tendency of many therapists to tell these patients to try harder, or imply that 
they indeed are not trying hard enough, can be one of the patient's most in­
validating experiences in psychotherapy. (This is not to say that in a well-
thought-out strategic approach, a therapist might not use a phrase such as 
this to influence a patient.) 
2. Patients Want to Improve 
The second assumption is a corollary to the first, and is similar to the as­
sumption therapists and crisis workers make with suicidal patients: If they 
are calling for help, they must want to live. Why else would they call? Bor­
derline patients are so used to hearing that their behavioral failures and difficul­
ties with therapeutic interventions stem from motivational deficits that they 
begin to believe it themselves. Assuming that patients want to improve, of 
course, does not preclude analysis of all of the factors interfering with moti­
vation to improve. Fear- or shame-based inhibition, behavioral deficits, faulty 
beliefs about outcomes, and faaors that reinforce behavioral regressions over 
improvement are all important. The assumption by therapists that failures 
to improve sufficiently or quickly are based on failure of intent, however, is 
at best faulty logic and at worst one more faaor that interferes with motivation. 
3. Patients Need to Do Better, Try Harder, and 
Be More Motivated to Change 
The third assumption may appear to contradict the first two, but I do not 
think so. The fact that borderline patients are doing the best they can and 
want to do even better does not mean that their efforts and motivation are 
--- Page 126 ---
Overview of Treatment 107 
sufficient to the task; often they are not. The task of a therapist, therefore, 
is to analyze factors that inhibit or interfere with a patient's efforts and moti­
vation to improve, and then to use problem solving strategies to help the pa­
tient increase her efforts and purify (so to speak) her motivation. 
4. Patients May Not Have Caused All of Their Own 
Problems, but They Have to Solve Them Anyway 
The fourth assumption simply verbalizes the belief in DBT that a borderline 
patient has to change her own behavioral responses and alter her environ­
ment for her life to change. Improvement will not result from the patient's 
simply coming to a therapist and gaining insight, taking a medication, receiv­
ing consistent nurturing, finding the perfect relationship, or resigning herself 
to the grace of God. Most importantly, the therapist cannot save the patient. 
Although it may be true that the patient cannot change on her own and that 
she needs help, the lion's share of the work nonetheless will be done by the 
patient. Would that it were not so! Surely if we could save patients, we would 
save them. It is essential that the DBT therapist make this assumption very 
clear to the patient, especially during crises. 
5. The Lives of Suicidal, Borderline Individuals Are 
Unbearable as They Are Currently Being Lived 
The fifth assumption is that borderline patients' frequently voiced dissatis­
factions with their lives are valid. They are indeed in a living hell. If patients' 
complaints and descriptions of their own lives are taken at all seriously, this 
assumption is self-evident. Given this fact, the only solution is to change their 
lives. 
6. Patients Must Learn New Behaviors 
in All Relevant Contexts 
Borderline individuals are mood-dependent, and thus they must make im­
portant changes in their styles of coping under extreme emotions, not just 
when they are in a state of emotional equilibrium. With some exceptions, 
DBT does not generally favor hospitalization even during crises, since hospitaH-
zation takes individuals out of the environment where they need to learn new 
skills. Nor does DBT particularly favor taking care of patients when stress 
is extreme or seems unbearable. Times of stress are the times to learn new 
ways of coping. 
Not taking care of a. patient does not mean that a DBT therapist does 
not take care/or the patient. The task of the therapist during crises is to stick 
to the patient like glue, whispering encouragement and helpful suggestions 
in her ear all the while. Such an approach, in which the therapist is biased 
toward producing self-care from the patient during crises rather than taking 
care of the patient, can result in a number of risky encounters for the ther-
--- Page 127 ---
108 TREATMENT OVERVIEW AND GOALS 
apist. Acceptance of the possibility that the patient may commit suicide is 
an essential requisite for conducting DBT. The other alternative, however— 
in which the patient stays alive, but within a Hfe filled with intolerable emo­
tional pain —is not viewed as tenable. 
7. Patients Cannot Fail in Therapy 
The seventh assumption is that when patients drop out of therapy, fail to 
progress, or actually get worse while in DBT, the therapy, the therapist, or 
both have failed. If the therapy has been applied according to protocol, and 
the patients still do not improve, then the failure is attributable to the thera­
py itself. This contrasts with the assumption of many therapists that when 
patients drop out or fail to improve, it can be attributed to a deficit in their 
motivation. Even if this assumption is true, the job of therapy is to enhance 
motivation sufficiently for the patients to progress. 
8. Therapists Treating Borderline Patients Need Support 
As noted throughout this book, borderline patients are one of the most difficult 
populations to treat with psychotherapy. Over and over, therapists seem to 
make mistakes that interfere with the patients' progress. Some of the problem 
stems from the patients' intense cries for immediate escape from suffering. 
Often therapists are capable of soothing the pain, but giving such relief fre­
quently interferes with providing help for the longterm. Therapists get caught 
between these demands for immediate relief and for long-term cure. Many 
other factors make it difficult for therapists to remain therapeutic with bor­
derline patients. A cosupervision group, a treatment team, a consultant, or 
a supervisor is important for keeping therapists on track. 
Therapist Characteristics and Skills 
"Therapist characteristics," in this context, are the attitudes and pervasive in­
terpersonal positions that the therapist takes in relationship to the patient. 
Briefly, the therapist must balance the patient's capabilities and deficiencies, 
flexibly synthesizing acceptance and nurturing strategies with change-
demanding strategies in a clear and centered mannen Exhortations to change 
must be integrated with infinite patience. Since the dialeaical emphasis in 
DBT is large, a therapist must be comfortable with the ambiguity and para­
dox inherent in DBT strategies. Therapists who need black-and-white con­
ceptualizations, goals, or methods are likely to experience DBT as dissonant 
when confronted with the dialectic inherent in actions to control patients' 
destructive behaviors while also promoting growth and self-reliance. 
Requisite therapist characteristics are illustrated in Figure 4.1. Although 
they are presented in terms of bipolar attributes, the correct DBT stance is

a synthesis or balance between the poles of each dimension; thus, the ther­
apist stands at the center of each dimension. The synthesis of acceptance and 
change represents the central dialeaical balance that the therapist must achieve 
in DBT. The other two dialeaical dimensions—unwavering centeredness versus 
compassionate flexibility, and benevolent demanding versus nurturing —are 
reflections of this central dimension. 
Stance of Acceptance versus Change 
The first dimension is something I have been discussing throughout this book: 
the balance of an orientation toward acceptance with an orientation toward 
change. By "acceptance" here, I mean something quite radical —namely ac­
ceptance of both the patient and the therapist, of both the therapeutic rela­
tionship and the therapeutic process, exaaly as all of these are in the moment. 
This is not an acceptance in order to bring about change; otherwise, it would 
be a change strategy. Rather, it is the therapist's willingness to find the inher­
ent wisdom and "goodness" of the current moment and the participants in 
it, and to enter fully into the experience without judgment, blame, or manipu­
lation. As noted previously, however, reality is change, and the nature of any 
relationship is that of reciprocal influence. In particular, a therapeutic rela­
tionship is one that originates in the necessity of change and the patient's 
wish to obtain professional help in the process of changing. An orientation 
toward change requires that the therapist take responsibility for directing the 
therapeutic influence, or change, to the advantage of the patient. Such a stance 
is active and self-conscious; it involves systematically applying principles of 
behavior change. 
--- Page 129 ---
110 TREATMENT OVERVIEW AND GOALS 
From the perspeaive of acceptance versus change, DBT represents a 
balance between behavioral approaches, which are primarily technologies of 
change, and humanistic and client-centered approaches, which can be thought 
of as technologies of acceptance. In DBT, the therapist not only models a 
change —acceptance synthesis but also encourages such a life stance to the 
patient, advocating change and amelioration of undesired aspects of herself 
and situations, as well as tolerance and acceptance of these same charaaeris­
tics. Teaching mindfulness and distress tolerance skills is balanced by teach­
ing skills in emotional control and interpersonal effectiveness in conflict 
situations. 
Crucial to the balance of acceptance and change is the therapist's ability 
to express warmth and control simultaneously in therapy settings. Much of 
the control in changing patient behavior is achieved through the use of the 
relationship; without a significant level of concurrent warmth and acceptance, 
the therapist will probably be experienced as hostile and demanding rather 
than as caring and helpful. 
Stance of Unwavering Centeredness 
versus Compassionate Flexibility 
"Unwavering centeredness" is the quality of believing in oneself, in the thera­
py, and in the patient. It is calmness in the middle of chaos, much like the 
center of a hurricane. It requires a certain clarity of mind with respea to what 
the patient needs in the long run, as well as an ability to tolerate the intensity 
and pain experienced by the patient without flinching in the short run. Cen­
teredness in DBT does not mean maintaining arbitrary boundaries as it does 
in some other therapies. Nor does it require more than the usual consistency 
(except in the commitment to the patient's welfare). Neither arbitrary bound­
aries nor consistency is particularly valued in DBT. 
"Compassionate flexibility" refers to the contrasting ability of the ther­
apist to take in relevant information about the status of the patient and to 
modify his or her position accordingly. It is the ability to let go freely of a 
position that was formerly clung to tenaciously. If centeredness is keeping 
one's feet on the ground, flexibility is moving your shoulders to the side to 
let the patient by. Flexibility is that quality of the therapist that is light, respon­
sive, and creative. Dialectically, it is the ability to change the boundaries of 
the problem, finding and including what has been previously excluded. 
Given the odds of making mistakes in conducting DBT, an overall will­
ingness to admit and repair mistakes made in the course of the therapeutic 
relationship is essential. To put it another way, in such a complex and difficult 
therapeutic endeavor, mistakes are inevitable; what the therapist does after­
wards is a better index of good therapy. Whether the mistake is smiling at 
the wrong moment and being perceived as mocking rather than warm, get­
ting into power struggles, or becoming impatient with the patient's slow 
progress and then rejecting her by not returning telephone calls and behaving 
--- Page 130 ---
Overview of Treatment 111 
coldly, the effective therapist must be able to acknowledge such actions as 
errors. Higher-functioning patients may be able to experience both trust in 
their therapists and painful affect arising from some therapist actions, and 
thus may not require as much repair work. Borderline patients are not likely 
to be in this category, however, and their therapists may become identified 
with other abusive individuals in their lives. Without therapist validation of 
a patient's experience and flexible attempts at problem solving in the situa­
tion, the therapeutic relationship becomes for the patient one more mistaken 
trust, one more failed relationship that must be either fled or hopelessly en­
dured. Furthermore, a therapist must be able to tolerate both frustration at 
the patient's rejection of seemingly appropriate interventions and progress that 
may appear glacial. Flexibility in strategies and timing is the key to any 
progress. 
The balance between unwavering centeredness and compassionate flexi­
bility means that the therapist must be capable of observing limits and con­
ditions, often in the face of massive and often quite desperate attempts on 
the part of the patient to control the therapist's response, while at the same 
time flexibly changing, adapting, and "giving in" as the situation requires. 
The therapist must both be alert to his or her own rigidity (a natural reaction 
to the stress of the therapeutic situation) and falling into the trap of giving 
in to every wish, demand, or current need of the patient. 
In working with a suicidal borderline patient, the balance between these 
two extremes becomes most salient when the therapist has placed a dysfunc­
tional interpersonal behavior pattern of the patient on an extinction sched­
ule. The ability to stay centered and maintain the schedule is imperative, lest 
the therapist inadvertently put the patient on an intermittent reinforcement 
schedule, in which case the dysfunaional behavior will become highly resis­
tant to therapeutic change. This is a simple fact of operant leaming sched­
ules. But with a suicidal patient in particular, a therapist can be overly rigid 
in applying an extinaion program and fail to respond adequately to the pa­
tient's legitimate needs. As one of my patients pointed out, it is normal in 
all societies to give people more care and attention when they are sick. Yet 
not everyone stays sick to get care and attention. 
Stance of Nurturing versus Benevolent Demanding 
In DBT, there is a high degree of nurturing of the patient. The qualities of 
"nurturing" in this context include teaching, coaching, assisting, strengthen­
ing, and aiding the patient, aU from a stance of cherishing the patient's abili­
ties to learn and change. A willingness and certain ease in taking care for 
and nurturing the patient are needed. Compassion and sensitivity are essen­
tial with patients who are as sensitive while simultaneously as constriaed and 
limited in emotional expression as most borderline individuals. Without these 
qualities, a therapist is always two steps behind the patient's often subtie reac­
tions to the therapist's statements, remarks of other group members, and in-
--- Page 131 ---
112 TREATMENT OVERVIEW AND GOALS 
ternal or environmental cues. Although a major effort is devoted in DBT to 
teaching patients how to identify and verbalize emotions, therapists who can­
not come very close to mind reading in the earlier stages of treatment are 
likely to believe that borderline clients deliberately sabotage therapy with capri­
cious behavior, or that patients who are really experiencing fear and help­
lessness are hostile and attacking. 
A therapist must balance giving a patient the real help she needs with 
not giving unneeded help. "Benevolent demanding" is the therapist's recogni­
tion of the patient's existing capacities, reinforcement of adaptive behavior 
and self-control, and refusal to take care of the patient when she can care 
for herself. Generally, adept use of contingencies (i.e., demanding change as 
a prerequisite for outcomes the patient desires) is crucial. A certain ability 
to be tough when the situation warrants it is a requisite therapist characteris­
tic. The dialeaical position here is to push the patient forward with one hand 
while supporting her with the other hand. Thus, nurturing is in the service 
of strengthening the capabilities of the patient. As I have noted above in dis­
cussing assumptions about the patient and the treatment, the balance is that 
between taking care of and taking care for the patient. It is using both the 
carrot and the stick to promote change. 
Agreements of Patients and Therapists 
Patient Agreements 
DBT requires a number of patient agreements. Generally, these are required 
for formal acceptance into the treatment and are the conditions of treatment. 
They should be discussed and clarified during the first several sessions, and 
at least oral agreement should be obtained. A written contract can be used 
at the discretion of the therapist. 
One-Year Therapy Agreement 
Uses of a Renewable Time-Limited Approach. Following the first one 
or several sessions, the patient and therapist should agree explicitly on whether 
they will work together and for how long. It should not be automatically 
assumed that the patient wants to work with the therapist. Under ordinary 
circumstances, the patient and therapist make a 1-year agreement, renewable 
annually At the end of each year of treatment, progress is evaluated, and the 
question of whether to continue working together is discussed. Therapists 
will differ on what is required for continuation. Some therapists are willing 
to work with patients on a long-term basis and wiU renew the agreement each 
year unless there is some problem or the patients have met their goals. Other 
therapists are much more oriented to time-limited therapy and will want to 
set up therapeutic relationships with a clear intent at the beginning to refer 
the patients elsewhere at the end of the year, if treatment is still necessary 
--- Page 132 ---
Overview of Treatment 113 
DBT conducted on an inpatient unit may be very time-limited. 
Some borderline patients cannot tolerate a nonrenewable time-limited 
approach. They cannot open up emotionally or verbally when they know that 
the therapy is going to end at an arbitrary point. These patients should not 
be forced into nonrenewable time-limited therapy. Obviously, with nonrenew­
able time-limited approaches, the goals of therapy may be narrower than for 
long-term therapy. For example, I have taken several patients into time-limited 
DBT who have histories of many psychiatric hospitalizations; have bumed out 
and been rejected by several previous therapists; are currently dysfunctional 
and chronically parasuicidal; and cannot find another therapist to work with 
them. Some have been on the no-admit lists of more than one area hospital. In 
these instances, I have made it very clear to the patients that I will work with 
them for 1 year and then help them find another therapist. My goal is to help 
them stop their parasuicidal behavior and learn how to function effeaively 
in therapy, so that they can benefit from and keep their next therapist. I think 
of this as a sort of pretreatment for the long-term work that is needed. 
Circumstances of Unilateral Termination. During the first several ses­
sions, the therapist should make the circumstances that will lead to unilater­
al therapy termination very clear. DBT has only one formal termination rule: 
Patients who miss 4 weeks of scheduled therapy in a row, either required skills 
training or individual therapy, are out of the program. They cannot return 
to therapy until the end of the current contracted period, and then return 
is a matter of negotiation. There are no circumstances under which this rule 
is broken. There are no good reasons in DBT for missing 4 weeks of sched­
uled therapy. This rule was originally adopted for research reasons; we need­
ed to have an operational definition of therapy termination. However, I have 
found that it is an excellent clinical rule. It very clearly defines what consti­
tutes missed sessions (up to three in a row) and what constitutes dropping 
out (four missed individual or required skills training sessions in a row). Thus, 
patients who miss one, two, or three sessions in a row know that they will 
be welcomed back, and they know unequivocally that if they miss a fourth 
they wiU not be allowed to return. In this manner, the "drift-out-of-therapy" 
phenomenon is reduced. 
Many borderline patients want their therapists to make an uncondition­
al commitment to continue therapy indefinitely or until the end of the time-
limited period (depending on the original agreement), no matter what. Such 
a patient will say that she cannot trust the therapist, self-disclose, or the Hke, 
because she is afraid that the therapist will end the relationship. She may worry 
constantly about this possibility. It is very tempting to reassure such a patient 
that no matter what she does or says in therapy, she will not be terminated 
before she is ready. DBT does not advocate this stance. Instead, the position 
taken is somewhat like that in a marriage. Although the therapist commits 
himself or herself to working with the patient, to sticking with difficult process­
es, and to trying to resolve any therapeutic problems that arise, the therapy 
--- Page 133 ---
114 TREATMENT OVERVIEW AND GOALS 
commitment is not unconditional. If the therapist finds it impossible to help 
the patient further, if the patient pushes the therapist beyond his or her limits, 
or if an unexpeaed mitigating condition (such as moving out of town) arises, 
therapy termination will be considered. As I tell my patients, even a mother's 
love is not unconditional. The agreement that the therapist does make, how­
ever, is to do his or her best to protect the patient from unilateral termina­
tion. When the patient's behavior is precipitating termination, this means that 
the therapist will (1) alert the patient to impending danger of termination 
in enough time for the patient to make necessary changes in her own behavior, 
and (2) assist her in making the changes. (As the next two chapters indicate 
more clearly, behaviors that threaten to terminate therapy prematurely are 
the second most important treatment target.) Similarly, although the patient 
can terminate treatment at any time, it is expected that she will terminate 
by coming to a session and discussing the proposed termination with her in­
dividual therapist. 
Attendance Agreement 
The next agreement is that the patient will attend all scheduled therapy ses­
sions. Individual skills training and therapy sessions will be rescheduled if 
both the therapist and the patient can do so conveniently. If a missed group 
session is videotaped, the patient can view the missed session before the next 
one. The therapist should communicate clearly to the patient that it is not 
acceptable for her to miss sessions because she finds them too aversive, is not 
in the mood for therapy, wishes to avoid a particular topic, or feels hopeless. 
Suicidal Behaviors Agreement 
If suicidal behaviors (including parasuicide without intent to die) are a problem 
for the patient, she should be advised that reducing such behaviors is a primary 
treatment goal. The basic agreement needed is that, all other things being 
equal, the patient will work toward solving problems in ways that do not in­
clude intentional self-harm, attempts to die, or suicide. It should be empha­
sized that if this is not one of her goals, then DBT may not be the appropriate 
program for hen The therapist must be especially attentive to the patient's am­
bivalence with regard to suicidal behaviors. Thus, although an explicit verbal 
commitment to reducing such behaviors is the goal, less explicit commitments 
can be accepted. At times, a patient may agree to attend therapy with the 
understanding that reducing suicidal behaviors is the goal of the therapy, but 
she may not be able to make an explicit statement that she will not commit 
suicide. Struauring this agreement is discussed in more detail in Chapter 14. 
Therapy-Interfering Behaviors Agreement 
The next agreement is simply to work on any problems that interfere with 
the progress of therapy Making this agreement explicit highlights the nature 
of therapy as an interpersonal, collaborative relationship at the very beginning.

Overview of Treatment 115 
Skills Training Agreement 
If one major aim of the therapy is to help the patient substitute skilled 
responses for previous dysfunaional responses, then it seems clear that she 
has to learn the needed behavioral skills somewhere. During the first year 
of DBT, all patients must take part in the DBT skills training program (or, 
if impossible, another equivalent program). 
Research and Payment Agreement 
If DBT is carried out in a research context, the patient must be informed of 
and agree to participate in the research condition. Patient fees should be made 
clear, and a method of payment should be agreed on. 
Therapist Agreements 
It is very important that the therapist state clearly what the patient can ex­
pect from him or her. Therapist agreements in our program are as follows. 
"Every Reasonable Effort" Agreement 
The maximum that patients can expect from therapists is that they will make 
every reasonable effort to conduct the therapy as competently as possible. 
Patients can expect therapists to make their best effort to be helpful, to help 
them gain insight and learn new skills, and to teach them some of the be­
havioral tools they need to deal more effeaively with their current living sit­
uations. Therapists should make it clear that they cannot save the patients, 
cannot solve the patients' problems and cannot keep the patients from en­
gaging in suicidal behavior. This point flows directly out of the assumption 
about patients, discussed earlier, that they have to solve their own life problems. 
It is often useful for a therapist to go over common misconceptions about 
therapy. A major misconception is often that the therapist can somehow make 
everything better. The therapist's inability to take away the intense pain, or 
sometimes even to lessen it somewhat, is often interpreted as uncaring or un­
willingness to help. It is important that the therapist not imply that when 
the patient "grows up" or is "less narcissistic" she will see that this is not true. 
Instead, the task of the DBT therapist is actively to counter such beliefs and 
assumptions. I find it useful to emphasize that although I can help a patient 
develop and practice new behaviors that may be helpful in reshaping her life, 
I cannot in the final analysis reshape her Hfe for her. The metaphor of the 
therapist as guide can be helpful here. I can show someone the way, but I 
cannot walk the trail for her. The caring is in staying with the patient on 
the path. Statements to this effect are often needed periodically throughout 
the treatment process. 
Ethics Agreement 
Ethical condua can be a very salient issue in treating borderline patients. In 
my clinic, many of our patients have had previous therapists who engaged 
--- Page 135 ---
116 TREATMENT OVERVIEW AND GOALS 
in extremely questionable, and at times clearly unethical, behaviors. Sexual 
involvement and dual relationships that clearly cross the boundaries of effec­
tive therapy are cases in point. Thus, an explicit agreement to obey standard 
ethical guidelines and professional codes is particularly important. 
Personal Contact Agreement 
Like the patient (see above), the therapist agrees to come to every scheduled 
session, to cancel sessions in advance when needed, and to reschedule 
whenever possible. The length of sessions should be discussed, and the pa­
tient's preferences and prior therapy experience should be ascertained. The 
intent is to provide sessions of reasonable length that are not cut short for 
arbitrary reasons. In addition to providing reasonable backup coverage when 
the therapist is out of town or unavailable, the therapist also agrees to pro­
vide reasonable phone contaa. How much contaa is reasonable is determined 
both by the DBT telephone strategies (see Chapter 15) and by the observing-
limits approach (see Chapter 10). 
Respect-for-Patient Agreement 
It seems obvious, but is helpful to discuss anyway, that the therapist must 
be willing to respea the integrity and rights of the patient. Although respea-
ing the patient is essential to effective therapy, the agreement here goes be­
yond considerations of helping the patient make needed behavioral changes. 
Confidentiality Agreement 
The therapist agrees that all information revealed in therapy will be held in 
strict confidence. GeneraUy, only the members of the treatment team and the 
research staff (if a research project is in progress) are aUowed access to thera­
py videotapes or audiotapes, session notes, and assessment materials. (It should 
go without saying, of course, that appropriate release-of-information forms 
are signed.) Even within the DBT team and supervision meetings, the ther­
apist agrees to keep sensitive, potentially embarrassing, and very private in­
formation confidential unless there is a compelling need to do otherwise. 
Records of sessions are kept secure. It should also be stressed, however, that 
the therapist is not bound to confidentiality when the patient is threatening 
suicide or in other circumstances where therapists are required by law to report 
things patients say to them. When doing so is necessary to maintain the pa­
tient's safety or that of others, such threats may be communicated to other 
people-either those in the patient's home environment or members of the 
legal or mental health professional community. 
Consultation Agreement 
Therapists agree to obtain therapy consultation when needed. In standard 
DBT, all therapists agree to attend regulariy scheduled case consultation meet-
--- Page 136 ---
Overview of Treatment 117 
ings, either with a supervisor, peer supervision group, or other members of 
the patient's treatment team. The basic idea, here, is that the patient can count 
on the therapist to get help when needed rather than, for example, continue 
indefinitely with ineffective treatment or blame the patient for problems in 
the therapy. 
Therapist Consultation Agreements 
Much as the therapist and patient do, therapists in cosupervision or a case 
consultation group agree to interact with one another in certain ways. The 
agreements have to do with foUowing the general DBT guidelines within the 
context of the supervision or case consultation meetings. That is, therapists 
agree to treat each other at least as well as they treat their patients. In addi­
tion, the agreements are intended to facilitate staying within a DBT frame 
with patients. 
Dialectical Agreement 
The DBT case consultation group agrees to accept, at least pragmatically, a 
dialeaical philosophy. There is no absolute truth; therefore, when polarities 
arise, the task is to search for the synthesis rather than for the truth. The 
dialeaical agreement does not proscribe strong opinions, nor does it suggest 
that polarities are undesirable. Rather, it simply points to the direction ther­
apists agree to take when passionately held polar positions threaten to split 
the consultation team. 
Consultation-to-the-Patient Agreement 
The spirit of treatment planning in DBT is that therapists do not serve as 
intermediaries for patients with other professionals, including other mem­
bers of the treatment team. The DBT case consultation group agrees that the 
task of the individual therapists is to consult with their own patients on how 
to interaa with other therapists, not to teU other therapists how to interact 
with the patients. Thus, when a therapist behaves fallibly (within reason), 
the task of the other therapists on the team is to help their patients cope with 
this therapist's behavior, not necessarily to reform the therapist. This does 
not mean that the team members do not condua treatment planning together 
for their patients, exchange information about the patients (including their 
problems with other members of the treatment team), and discuss problems 
in treatment. This agreement is discussed more fully in Chapter 13. 
Consistency Agreement 
Failures in carrying out treatment plans are opportunities for patients to learn 
to deal with the real worid. The job of the therapy team is not to provide 
a stress-free, perfect environment for the patients. Thus, the consuhation 
--- Page 137 ---
118 TREATMENT OVERVIEW AND GOALS 
group, including all members of the treatment team, agrees that consistency 
of therapists with one another is not necessarily expeaed; each therapist does 
not have to teach the same thing, nor do all have to agree on what are proper 
rules for therapy. Each therapist can make his or her own rules about condi­
tions of therapy with himself or herself. Although it can make for smooth 
sailing when all members of an institution, agency, or clinic communicate 
the unit's rules accurately and clearly, mix-ups are viewed as inevitable and 
isomorphic with the world we all live in; they are seen as a chance for pa­
tients (as well as therapists) to practice almost all of the skills taught in DBT. 
Observing-Limits Agreement 
The case consultation group agrees that all therapists are to observe their own 
personal and professional limits. Furthermore, consultation group members 
agree not to infer that narrow limits reflect therapists' fears of intimacy, 
self-centeredness, problems with dominance and control, or generally with­
holding nature, or that broad limits reflect a need to nurture, problems with 
boundaries, or projeaive identification. Patients can learn to figure out the 
limits. 
Phenomenological Empathy Agreement 
The therapists agree, all other things being equal, to search for nonpejorative 
or phenomenologically empathic interpretations of patients' behavior. The 
agreement is based on the fundamental assumption (described earlier) that 
the patients are trying their best and want to improve, rather than to sabotage 
the therapy or "play games" with their therapist. When a therapist is unable 
to come up with such an interpretation, other consultation group members 
agree to assist in doing so, meanwhile also validating the "blame the victim" 
mentality of the therapist. Thus, consultation group members agree to hold 
one another nonjudgmentally in the DBT frame. They agree not to label ther­
apists who always adopt the empathic interpretation as naive, unsophisticated, 
or overly identified with their patients; they also agree not to label therapists 
who always adopt the hostile, pejorative, "blame the victim" interpretation 
as aggressive, dominating, or vindictive. 
Fallibility Agreement 
In DBT, there is an expHcit agreement that all therapists are fallible. Put in 
the vernacular, this means that, relatively speaking, "therapists are all jerks." 
Thus, there is littie need to be defensive, since it is agreed ahead of time that 
therapists have probably done whatever problematic things they are accused 
of. The task of the consultation group members is to apply DBT to one 
another, in order to help each therapist stay within the DBT protocols. As 
with patients, however, problem solving with therapists must be balanced with 
--- Page 138 ---
Overview of Treatment 119 
validation of inherent wisdom of the therapists' stance. Because, in principle, 
all therapists are fallible, it is agreed that they will inevitably violate all of 
the agreements discussed here. When this is done, they wiU rely on one another 
to point out the polarity and will move to search for the synthesis. 
Concluding Comments 
The assumptions about therapy and borderline patients, as well as the pa­
tient, therapist, and consultation group agreements, form the ground work 
context on which DBT is built and provide a basis for therapeutic decision 
making throughout the treatment. The experienced therapist has no doubt 
noticed that DBT overlaps extensively with many other therapeutic schools, 
including those identified as behavioral and cognitive-behavioral as well as 
those that are not. Although there may be little if anything actually new in 
DBT, the threads of therapeutic advice (and I hope, wisdom) dispensed across 
many therapy manuals and treatises on the care of BPD are at times woven 
together slightly differently in DBT. The next two chapters, and the third sec­
tion of the book, are devoted to outlining the specific therapist aaions and 
decision rules that define DBT. In Chapters 5 and 6,1 describe in much great­
er detail the behavioral pattems targeted in DBT. Telling therapists which pa­
tient behaviors to focus on is an important part of any treatment manual; 
for some, it forms the bulk of the therapy description. In Part III, I describe 
the specific treatment strategies and procedures used in contaas with patients. 
The application of treatment strategies in any approach is stiU more of an 
art than a science, but I try to elucidate as far as possible the rules that should 
guide this application in DBT.

Behavioral Targets in 
Treatment: Behaviors to 
Increase and Decrease 
I n standard cognitive-behavioral ther­
apy, treatment goals are usually described in terms of behavioral targets— 
that is, behaviors to increase and behaviors to decrease. I have used the same 
convention here. In DBT, each target is a class of behaviors relating to a cer­
tain theme or area of functioning. The specific behaviors targeted within each 
behavioral class are individualized for each patient; target selection depends 
on initial and continuing behavioral assessment. This point cannot be over­
emphasized. 
The Overall Goal: 
increasing Dialectical Behavior Patterns 
The overriding and pervasive target of DBT is to increase dialectical behavior 
patterns among borderline patients. Put simply, this means both enhancing 
dialectical patterns of thought and cognitive functioning, and also helping 
patients to change their typically extreme behaviors into more balanced, in­
tegrative responses to the moment. 
Dialectical Thinking 
Dialectical thinking is the "middle path" between universalistic thinking and 
relativistic thinking. Universalistic thinking assumes that there are fixed, 
universal truths and a universal order to things. Truth is absolute; in disagree­
ments, one person is right and one person is wrong. Relativistic thinking as­
sumes that there is no universal truth and that the order of things depends 
120 
--- Page 140 ---
Behavioral Targets In Treatment 121 
entirely on who is doing the ordering. Truth is relative; in disagreements, it 
is pointless to search for truth, since truth is in the eye of the beholder. By 
contrast, dialeaical thinking assumes that truth and order evolve and develop 
over time. In disagreements, truth is sought through efforts to discover what 
is left out of the ways both participants are ordering events. Truth is created 
by a new ordering that embraces and includes what was previously excluded 
by both (Basseches, 1984, p. 11). 
Thus, dialectical thinking is more akin to constructive thinking, where 
the emphasis is on observing fundamental changes that occur through peo­
ple's interaction with their environments. The cognitive therapy approach of 
Michael Mahoney (1991), which he describes as a "developmental construc­
tive" approach to therapy, is a good example of constructive thinking. It 
contrasts with a nondialectical pattern of thinking, such as struauralism, 
which emphasizes finding patterns that stay the same over time and circum­
stances. 
As I have discussed in Chapter 2, dialectical thinking requires the abili­
ties to transcend polarities and, instead, to see reality as complex and mul­
tifaceted; to entertain contradiaory thoughts and points of view, and to unite 
and integrate them; to be comfortable within flux and inconsistency; and to 
recognize that any aU-encompassing point of view contains its own contradic­
tions. When one is stuck in considering a problem, a dialectical approach 
would be to consider what has been left out or how one has artificially nar­
rowed the boundaries or simplified the problem. Borderline individuals, by 
contrast, think in extremes and hold rigidly to points of view. Life is black 
or white, viewed in dichotomous units. They often have difficulty receiving 
new information; they search instead for absolute truths and concrete facts 
that never change. The overall goal of DBT is not to get patients to view real­
ity as a series of grays, but rather to help them see both black and white, 
and to achieve a synthesis of the two that does not negate the reality of 
either. 
For those who are not dialectical thinkers, or even for those who are 
but have never thought about it, it can be difficult to grasp exactly what is 
being discussed here. Here is an example: Imagine a patient who grew up 
in a family with a very strong world view. As an adult, she rejects much of 
the world view important to her family and instead embraces a different view. 
Her family disapproves vehementiy. She believes that either she is right and 
her family is wrong, or her family is right and she is wrong. Whoever is wrong 
should abandon that viewpoint in favor of the other point of view. 
From a formalistic positon, the therapeutic task is to help the patient 
honesriy examine which position is closest to the tmth and understand fac­
tors that interfere with the acceptance of the truth. Either the patient is en­
gaged in dysfunctional thinking and should change her thinking style, or she 
is viewing things accurately and needs assistence in validating and believing 
herself. 
Relativistic thinking would imagine that neither worid view is right or 
--- Page 141 ---
122 TREATMENT OVERVIEW AND GOALS 
wrong. Therapy in this case might focus on helping the patient decide which 
world view is more useful to her. The focus might be on problems the patient 
has in taking responsibility for her own point of view and her dysfunctional 
need for others to decide for her or for others to agree with her. 
In contrast, a dialeaical therapist would assist the patient identify the 
influences over time on her world view and examine how her own actions, 
in turn, have influenced the world views of her family members and others 
she interaas with. Therapy here might focus on discovering whether anything 
is interfering with further development and change. Therapy might also focus 
on ways the family's world view has changed, as well as factors inhibiting 
further change. The therapist might lead the patient to explore how each world 
view adds to and follows from the other, suggesting that a different world 
view can be appreciated without invalidating one's own viewpoint. 
Here is another example. Suppose a patient tells her therapist that she 
is having many urges to commit suicide. After prolonged efforts at problem 
solving in this situation without any success, the therapist suggests that the 
patient admit herself to the local hospital until the danger has passed. The 
patient decides against hospitalization and refuses. The therapist proceeds 
to have her committed involuntarily to an in-patient hospital. At one point 
the patient may analyze the situation from a formal position. She may see 
her own needs and values as more important and of a higher order than the 
therapist's. After all, her safety is her own business. The job of therapists is 
not to push their values down patients' throats, locking them up when they 
disagree. She may decide to withhold information or to lie about her suicidal 
feelings in the future —to "play the game," so to speak—and to give up get­
ting help on solving problems that make her feel suicidal. 
At other times, the patient's thinking may be more relative and less ab­
solute. On the one hand, she thinks it is reasonable that she should be able 
to talk to her therapist about suicidal urges without threat of commitment. 
If she cannot refuse hospitalization, what is the point of the assertiveness ttain­
ing her therapist has given her? On the other hand, her therapist cares about 
her and wants her to stay alive, even if he or she has to use force to keep 
her alive. Both points of view make equal sense, but the conflict is unresolv-
able, so the patient is simply confused. 
If the patient can assume a dialectical stance, she can come to see the 
problem as a clash between the therapist's goal of creating conditions that 
enhance her autonomy and the therapist's obligation to protea her from harm. 
The task of enhancing the patient's autonomy may lead to practices that are 
not optimal for proteaing her from harm (teaching the patient assertion skiUs 
and encouraging trust in her own decision making). Conversely, the task of 
protecting the patient from harm may lead to practices that do not enhance 
her autonomy (committing the patient against her stated wishes). If the pa­
tient can come to accept and appreciate this state of affairs, she may decide 
to try working with the therapist on ways to deal with problems that make 
her feel suicidal, while at the same time working out ways to make her ther-
--- Page 142 ---

apist feel secure about her safety. She will have to make some compromises 
between autonomy and safety, just as her therapist does. However, she is 
resolved not to lose sight of her own therapeutic goals. She may decide to 
work very hard in therapy, in order to move toward transforming the system 
so that these two values do not conflict. ^ 
Dialectical Thinking and Cognitive Therapy 
The pervasive focus on nondialectical thinking in DBT is very similar to the 
focus on dysfunctional thinking in cognitive therapy. For example, cognitive 
errors targeted in cognitive therapy are also examples of nondialectical pat­
terns of thought. As in cognitive therapy, a task of the therapist in DBT is 
to help the patient identify her extreme and absolute thought patterns, and 
then to assist her in testing the validity of her conclusions and beliefs. 
Problematic thinking patterns targeted in both DBT and cognitive therapy 
are as follows: 
1. Arbitrary inferences or conclusions based on insufficient or contradic­
tory evidence. 
2. Overgeneralizations. 
3. Magnification and exaggeration of the meaning or significance of 
events. 
4. Inappropriate attribution of all blame and responsibility for negative 
events to oneself. 
5. Inappropriate attribution of all blame and responsibility for negative 
events to others. 
6. Name caUing, or the appHcation of negative trait labels that add no 
new information beyond the observed behavior used to generate the 
labels. 
7. Catastrophizing, or the presumption of disastrous results if certain 
events do not either continue or develop. 
8. Hopeless expectancies, or pessimistic predictions based on selective 
attention to negative events in the past or present, rather than on verifi­
able data. 
Some (but not all) forms of cognitive therapy emphasize an empirical 
form of reasoning, which holds that truth is what fits the facts, what works 
in aauality, what permits prediction in the material world, and what can be 
pointed to operationally. Thus, the main focus is on the truth or falsity of 
propositions, beliefs, and generalizations. If propositions were always "true 
and primary," the empirical approach would be sufficient, and there would 
be no need for the dialeaical approach. However, the spirit of dialectics is 
never to accept a final truth, an immobUe and indisputable fact. Although 
DBT favors the dialeaical method of reasoning, it does not hold that such 
reasoning is sufficient in itself. Empirical logic is not viewed as "wrong," es-
--- Page 143 ---
124 TREATMENT OVERVIEW AND GOALS 
pecially in problem solving, but it is treated as only one way to think. From 
this perspective, the synthesis of the two forms of reasoning is most useful 
for arriving at understanding. 
Dialectical Behavior Patterns: Balanced Lifestyle 
The easiest way to think about dialectical behavior patterns is to consider 
the idea of balance. Borderline individuals rarely lead balanced lifestyles. Not 
only their thinking, but their typical emotional responses and actions, are 
apt to be dichotomous and extreme. The borderline behavioral patterns— 
emotional vulnerability versus self-invalidation, unrelenting crises versus in­
hibited grieving, and active passivity versus apparent competence (see Chap­
ter 3) —are examples here. A focus on dialeaical behavior pattems emphasizes 
moving the patient toward more balanced and integrative responses to life 
situations. From a Buddhist perspective, this is walking the "middle path." 
In particular, the following dialectical tensions must be resolved: 
1. Skill enhancement versus self-acceptance. 
2. Problem solving versus problem acceptance. 
3. Affect regulation versus affea tolerance. 
4. Self-efficacy versus help seeking. 
5. Independence versus dependence. 
6. Transparency versus privacy. 
7. Trust versus suspicion. 
8. Emotional control versus emotional tolerance. 
9. Controlling/changing versus observing. 
10. Attending/watching versus participating. 
11. Needing from others versus giving to others. 
12. Self-focusing versus other-focusing. 
13. Contemplation/meditation versus action. 
Primary Behavioral Targets 
Decreasing Suicidal Behaviors 
As Mintz (1968) has pointed out, no psychotherapy is effective with a dead 
patient. Thus, when the life of a patient is under immediate threat, the focus 
of any therapy must shift to efforts to keep the patient alive. In most psy­
chotherapy simations, the threat to life is posed by suicidal behavior, but other 
behaviors may also qualify (e.g., continued fasting in an anorexic patient, 
neglea of a potentially fatal illness, putting oneself in danger of a victim-
precipitated homicide). As I have noted in Chapter 1, suicidal behaviors, in­
cluding completed suicide and parasuicidal aas committed with intent to die, 
are particularly prevalent among borderiine patients. In conttast to many other 
patient populations, however, and as Chapater 1 likewise notes, borderiine 
--- Page 144 ---
Behavioral Targets In Treatment 125 
patients also have a high incidence of parasuicidal behaviors not accompa­
nied by any intent to die. At least among some patients, parasuicidal behaviors 
are unHkely to prove fatal, and thus do not represent an immediate threat 
to the patients' lives. Nonetheless, parasuicidal acts of any type are high-
priority targets in DBT; the reasons for their importance are discussed below. 
Five subcategories of suicide-related behaviors are targeted in DBT: (1) sui­
cide crisis behaviors, (2) parasuicidal acts, (3) suicidal ideation and commu­
nications, (4) suicide-related expectancies and beliefs, and (5) suicide-related 
affect. 
Suicide Crisis Behaviors 
Suicide crisis behaviors are behaviors that convince the therapist or others 
that the patient is at high risk for imminent suicide. In most instances, these 
behaviors consist of some combination of credible suicide threats or other 
communications of upcoming suicide; suicide planning and preparations; ob­
taining and keeping avaUable lethal means (e.g., hoarding drugs or buying 
a gun); and high suicide intent. At times, indirect communications of suicide 
intent may also be suicide crisis behaviors. Whether or not the therapist be­
lieves that subsequent suicide is probable, these behaviors are never ignored 
The desire to be dead among borderline individuals is often reasonable, 
in that it is based on lives that are currently unbearable. A basic tenet of DBT 
is that the problem is rarely one of distorting positive situations into negative 
situations. Instead, the problem is usually that a patient simply has too many 
life crises, environmental stressors, problematic interpersonal relationships, 
difficult employment situations, and/or physical problems to enjoy life or find 
meaning in it. In addition, the patient's habitual dysfunctional behavior pat­
terns both create their own stress and interfere with any chance of improving 
the quality of life. In sum, borderline individuals usuaUy have good reasons 
for wanting to be dead. 
However, DBT therapists, even when confronted by lives of incalculable 
pain, are always on the side of life over death by suicide. The rationale for 
this stance against suicide is as follows. The agenda of many borderline pa­
tients seems at times to be to convince their therapists that life is indeed not 
worth living; such arguments may have many different functions. A patient 
may assume that if the therapist agrees, he or she wiU intervene directiy (mag­
ically, from my point of view) and change the quality of the patient's life. 
Or the patient may be trying to work up courage to commit suicide. Or the 
patient may be using the process of arguing with the therapist to elicit rea­
sons for hope and reassurance. Whatever the reason, I have at times been con­
vinced by patients that they are right. Not only did I believe that their lives 
were unlivable, but I myself saw no way out for them. I felt hopeless myself. 
My feelings of hopelessness about a particular patient, however, are no 
better as a guide to reading the future than are the patient's. That is, I have 
often felt hopeless about a patient who has subsequently improved the qual-
--- Page 145 ---
126 TREATMENT OVERVIEW AND GOALS 
ity of her life dramatically. I do not believe that this is a particular deficit 
on my part; feelings of hopelessness, at least in regard to borderline patients, 
are not uncommon among therapists. But, the therapist's own current life 
events, the state of the therapeutic relationship, and transitory moods of both 
therapist and patient influence these feelings of hopelessness certainly as much 
as factors actually prediaive of future progress do. 
Although a therapist may believe that a life of any quality is worth liv­
ing, the lives of many borderline individuals come perilously near the edge. 
Whether their intense suffering is a result of their own behavior or of uncon­
trollable environmental events is irrelevant; suffering is suffering. Indeed, one 
can make the case that keeping a patient alive within an untenable life is no 
admirable feat. This position has led me to assert that DBT is not a suicide 
prevention program, but a life improvement program. The desire to commit 
suicide, however, has at its base a belief that life cannot or will not improve. 
Although that may be the case in some instances, it is not true in all instances. 
Death, however, rules out hope in all instances. We do not have any data in­
dicating that people who are dead lead better lives. 
I believe that individuals at times make informed and rational decisions 
to commit suicide. I do not believe that this phenomenon is limited to those 
not in psychiatric or psychological treatment. Nor do I believe that border­
line patients are incapable of making an informed decision about whether 
to commit suicide or not. However, these beliefs in individual liberty do not 
mean that I must agree with any person that suicide is a good or even an 
acceptable choice. 
In the face of persistent attempts on the part of some borderline patients 
to convince their therapists that suicide is a good idea, as well as their occa­
sional success in such attempts, a therapist has to have a predetermined, non-
negotiable position on suicide. It cannot be a debatable option, lest the pa­
tient lose. I have chosen to be on the side of life. Although I value those whose 
therapeutic task is to help patients choose whether to live or die, opening 
up such a possibUity when treating borderline patients insures, it seems to 
me, that sometimes therapists will encourage suicide for individuals who, if 
they live, wUl not regret living. Knowing that some who live may regret that 
choice, therapists who take the stance of life must also, it seems to me, ac­
cept the responsibUity of helping these individuals in every way possible to 
create lives that are worth living. There is an old saying that the person who 
saves a life is then responsible for that life. 
Parasuicidal Acts 
Like suicide crisis behaviors, parasuicidal acts (see Chapter 1 for a full defi­
nition and discussion) are never ignored in DBT. Reducing parasuicidal acts 
is a high-priority target in DBT for a number of reasons. First, parasuicide 
is the best predictor of subsequent suicide. Among borderiine patients, the 
rate of completed suicide among individuals who engage in parasuicide is 
--- Page 146 ---
Behavioral Targets in Treatment 127 
twice the rate among those who do not (Stone, 1987b). Second, parasuicide 
damages the body, often irrevocably. Cutting and burning, for example, can­
not be undone; scars are permanent. Parasuicide not only damages the body, 
but holds out the possibility of accidental death. Third, actions based on the 
intent to harm one self are simply incompatible with every other goal of any 
therapy, including DBT. The effectiveness of all voluntary psychotherapy is 
based, at least to some extent, on developing an intent to help rather than 
harm one self. Thus, treatment of parasuicidal behavior goes to the heart 
of the therapeutic task. Fourth, it is quite difficult for a therapist to credibly 
communicate caring for a patient if the therapist does not react to the pa­
tient's harming herself. Responding to parasuicide by insisting that it must 
stop, and devoting the full resources of therapy to that end, are quintessential 
communications of compassion and care. The refusal to condone parasuici­
dal acts under any circumstances is, of course, a strategic therapeutic move, 
and it can be extraordinarily difficult for the therapist to maintain such a 
stance. 
Suicidal Ideation and Communications 
Another priority in DBT is to decrease the frequency and intensity of sui­
cidal ideation and communications. Targeted responses include thinking about 
suicide and parasuicide, experiencing urges to commit suicide or inflict self-
harm, having suicide-related images and fantasies, making suicide plans, 
threatening suicide, and talking about suicide. Borderline individuals often 
spend a considerable amount of time thinking about suicide. In these cases, 
suicidal ideation is a habitual response that may be unconneaed to any desire 
to die at the moment. The possibility of suicide reassures them that if things 
get too bad, there is always a way out. (I am reminded here of the giving of 
cyanide capsules to spies during wars. If they are caught, they can always avoid 
torture by committing suicide.) Other borderline individuals habitually threat­
en suicide at almost any provocation, but immediately withdraw or dismiss 
their threats. Still other borderline individuals at times agonize over whether 
to commit suicide or not; usually, such agonizing is accompanied by what 
seems like intolerable pain. Suicidal threats are always targeted directly. In 
contrast, suicide ideation is targeted directly only when it is new or unex­
peaed, is intense or aversive, is associated with parasuicide or suicide crises 
behaviors, or interferes with skillful problem solving. 
Suicide-Related Expectancies and Beliefs 
DBT likewise targets patients' expectations about the value of suicidal be­
havior as a problem-solving alternative. Unfortunately, many of these expec­
tations may be quite accurate. If a patient wants to seek revenge, make others 
sorry for what they did or did not do, escape an intolerable life situation, 
or even save others pain, suffering, and money, suicide may be the answer. 
--- Page 147 ---
128 TREATMENT OVERVIEW AND GOALS 
Parasuicide can also have beneficial effects. As 1 described in Chapter 2, a 
sense of relief after cutting or burning is extremely common even when the 
behavior is carried out in private. Getting sleep, a consequence of overdosing 
and other methods that cause unconsciousness, often has a substantial benefi­
cial effea on mood. Parasuicide of any sort, especially if it causes a great com­
motion, can be a very effective means of distraction from persistent negative 
affect and problematic situations. Finally, both suicide crisis behaviors and 
parasuicide are quite often effective ways for the patient to make others take 
her seriously, to obtain help and attention, to escape from situations, to re­
sume or terminate relationships, or to achieve desired but otherwise unavaU-
able hospitalizations. 
Thus, the expectations that are perhaps most in need of attention are 
not those about the realistic short-term consequences of suicidal behavior. 
Rather, expectations regarding long-range negative outcomes for suicidal be­
havior need to be addressed, as do expectations about alternative problem-
solvmg behaviors that may in the long mn prove more effeaive. Suicide-related 
expectations and beliefs are generally attended to directly only if they are in­
strumental to parasuicide, or suicide crisis behaviors or if they interfere with 
more skillful behaviors. 
Suicide-Related Affect 
As noted above, both parasuicidal acts and thinking about suicide are asso­
ciated with relief of intensely negative emotional states among some border­
line and suicidal individuals. These individuals may report feelings of 
relaxation, calmness, and emotional "release" from feelings of panic, intense 
anxiety, overwhelming anger, and unbearable shame after they engage in 
parasuicide or make plans to commit suicide. Such a conneaion may be due 
the result of instrumental learning, classical conditioning, or some immedi­
ate neurochemical effea of self-injury. At times, positive affeaive experiences, 
including sexual arousal, may accompany parasuicidal acts. An important 
goal of DBT is to change the individual's emotional response both to parasui­
cide and to thoughts, images, and fantasies of suicide and parasuicide. Like 
suicide-related expectations, suicide-related affect is generally attended to 
directly only if it is functionally related to parasuicide or suicide crisis be­
haviors or if it interferes with skillful behaviors. 
Postscript: Suicidal Behaviors as Maladaptive Problem Solving 
As is perhaps obvious from the foregoing, DBT views all suicidal behaviors 
as maladaptive problem-solving behaviors. As I have noted previously, whereas 
the therapist typically views suicidal behaviors as a problem, the patient often 
(but not always) views them as a solution. Thus, a first task of therapy is 
to work actively toward resolution of this fundamental difference in view­
points. A dialectical synthesis is the direction to head in. Once even a fragile 
synthesis is achieved (or reachieved), therapy is oriented to two fundamental 
--- Page 148 ---
Behavioral Targets in Treatment 129 
targets: (1) helping the patient build a life worth living and (2) replacing 
maladaptive attempts at problem solving with adaptive, skillful problem-
solving behaviors. Borderline patients often want to hold off on changing their 
problem-solving style until the factors that compromise the livability of their 
lives are reduced or removed. The emphasis in DBT is usually just the oppo­
site: "First we will stop the suicidal behaviors, and then we will figure out 
how to improve your life." As Chapter 9 indicates, such a dichotomy is in 
faa arbitrary, since the problem-solving strategies that form the heart of DBT 
change interventions work incrementally on both reducing troublesome be­
haviors and changing the personal and situational circumstances that precipi­
tate them. 
Decreasing Therapy-Interfering Behaviors 
The second target of DBT is the reduction of both patient and therapist be­
haviors that interfere with effeaive therapy, and, conversely, the increase of 
behaviors that enhance the continuation and effectiveness of therapy. The 
necessity of targeting this class of behaviors seems obvious. Patients who are 
not in therapy or who, though nominally in therapy, do not engage in or receive 
therapeutic aaivities, cannot benefit. Although the choice of whether to work 
together in the first place is a decision only a patient and therapist can make, 
whether they continue in a therapeutic relationship is a funaion of much more 
than simple decisional or choice behavior. Indeed, borderline patients fre­
quently have great difficulty translating decisions and choices into congruent 
behaviors. Cognitive control over overt behavior is not one of their strengths. 
For therapists, many external faaors, such as agency priorities, training needs, 
or financial considerations, may make following through on the decision to 
treat particular patients impossible. Furthermore, how a therapist chooses 
a patient is determined by a number of factors, including reinforcement his­
tory, behavioral capabilities, behavioral inhibitions, and current contingen­
cies operating in the therapeutic environment. The aim of DBT is to create 
contingencies, enhance capabUities, and reduce inhibitions so that the prob-
abUity of a patient's and therapist's continuing in therapy together is enhanced. 
DBT requires aaive participation on the part of both the patient and 
the therapist. During both individual and group sessions, the patient must 
coUaborate with the therapist in addressing therapeutic goals. Between ses­
sions, the patient must carry out homework assignments; in addition, the 
patient is expected to keep a number of agreements having to do with living 
arrangements and suicidal behavior. Thus, a patient may exhibit many types 
of behaviors that can lead to problems in treatment. Similarly, a therapist 
who does not deliver effective therapy or who engages in behaviors that in­
terfere with the patient's collaboration or continuation is rarely very helpful. 
The patient behaviors I am referring to here are similar to those included in 
the concept of "resistance" by psychodynamic and psychoanalytic therapists. 
The therapist behaviors I am referring to fall under the analytic rubric of 
--- Page 149 ---
130 TREATMENT OVERVIEW AND GOALS 
"countertransference," at least when countertransference is evaluated in negative 
terms. They also faU under the mbric of "relationship faaors" in more general 
discussions of psychotherapy. 
"Butterfly" versus "Attached" Patients 
Both borderline and parasuicidal patients are notorious for dropping out of 
therapy prematurely (Gunderson, 1984; Richman & Charles, 1976; Weiss­
man et al., 1973). In my experience, however, borderline patients usually fall 
into one of two types: "butterfly" patients and "attached" patients. Butterfly 
patients have great difficulty attaching to therapy; they fly in and out of their 
therapists' hands, so to speak. Attendance at sessions is episodic, agreements 
are often broken, and therapy or a therapeutic relationship does not appear 
to be a high priority. Therapy with such patients rarely focuses on the rela­
tionship with the therapist, unless the therapist initiates such a discussion. 
Generally, the patient is involved in one or more primary relationships with 
someone else, either parents, a spouse, or a partner. Phone calls to the ther­
apist usually concern the patient's personal crises rather than problems with 
the therapist. Most of her interpersonal energy goes into the alternate rela-
tionship(s) rather than into the therapeutic relationship. Whenever an alter­
nate relationship is secure, the patient may miss or terminate therapy. Usually, 
she has not a had long history of prior psychotherapy. An important therapy-
interfering behavior is the noninvolvement with the therapist. 
On the other end of the spectrum is the attached patient. Such an in­
dividual usually forms an almost immediate, intense relationship with the 
therapist. She almost never misses a session, and if she does she often asks 
(or demands) to reschedule it. The patient asks for and may need longer than 
usual sessions, more frequent sessions, and more phone calls to the therapist 
between sessions. From the start, difficulties within the therapeutic relation­
ship form an important focus of therapy. Often, the therapist is the patient's 
primary support person, and the therapeutic relationship is her primary in­
terpersonal relationship. Attached patients rarely drop out of therapy, have 
great difficulties when their therapists go on vacation, and are afraid of ter­
mination from the beginning. Many of these individuals have had long histo­
ries of psychotherapy relationships, which have reinforced their attachment 
behaviors. With these patients, an important area of therapy-interfering be­
haviors is their inability to tolerate imperfect therapists who are often unable 
to meet their needs. 
Traditional Cognitive and Behavior Therapy Approaches 
In reading some cognitive and behavioral treatment manuals and research, 
one often has the impression that getting a patient to collaborate and actual­
ly engage in the therapy is so easy that it does not bear discussion. With some 
patient populations, this is indeed the case. The attention being given to pa-
--- Page 150 ---
Behavioral Targets in Treatment 131 
tients' interfering behavior, however, is rapidly increasing. For example. Cham­
berlain et al. (1984) have developed a rating scale for patients' resistant be­
haviors. A number of articles and books have been written on patient 
compliance (Shelton & Levy, 1981; Meichenbaum & Turk, 1987). 
Cognitive-behavioral therapists regularly attend to the necessity of developing 
a collaborative relationship in therapy (Beck, Rush, Shaw, & Emery, 1979). 
In contrast, cognitive and behavior therapists have paid little attention 
to therapists' behaviors (other than technique) that interfere with or enhance 
therapy. Generally, the behavioral position has been twofold on this ques­
tion: First, the effect of therapist interpersonal factors on treatment outcome 
is an empirical question that cannot be answered without recourse to data; 
second, this empirical question must be addressed idiographically for each 
successive patient-therapist pair (Turkat & Brantley, 1981). Therapist be­
haviors that are effective for one patient-therapist pair may be completely 
ineffective for another pair. This twofold perspective is a direct outgrowth 
of the emphasis in cognitive and behavior therapy on applying empirical proce­
dures to the remediation of clinical problems. 
Therapy-enhancing behaviors discussed most frequently in the behavioral 
literature include those therapist qualities usually associated with client-
centered therapy (e.g., warmth, accurate empathy, and genuineness) and those 
derived from social-psychological studies of interpersonal influence (e.g., ther­
apist prestige, status, expertise and attraaiveness). The precise role that these 
various qualities play in effeaive behavior therapy remains controversial. Some 
behaviorists stress the lack of consistent empirical data on the effects of many 
therapist variables tradirionaUy thought to be important for therapeutic out­
come, especiaUy warmth and empathy (Morris & Magrath, 1983; Turkat & 
Brantley, 1981). Other behaviorists argue for their importance (Goldfried & 
Davison, 1976; Levis, 1980; WUson, 1984). Even those who clearly view 
specific therapist interpersonal behaviors as important, however, argue for 
an idiographic implementation to fit each particular patient (Arnkoff, 
1983; Wilson, 1984). Beck et al. (1979) perhaps express this behavioral view 
best when they advise that the individual therapist must proceed by observ­
ing the effects of his or her actions on the patient. DBT accepts such a point 
of view. 
Therapy-Interfering Behaviors of the Patient 
Three categories of behavior are included under the rubric of therapy-
interfering behaviors of the patient. The first category consists of any behaviors 
that interfere with the patient's receiving the therapy offered. A second 
category, seen in group and inpatient therapy settings, consists of behaviors 
that interfere with other patients' benefiting from the therapy. The third 
category consists of patient behaviors that burn out the therapist; included 
are behaviors that push the therapist's personal limits or decrease the ther­
apist's willingness to continue therapy. 
--- Page 151 ---
132 TREATMENT OVERVIEW AND GOALS 
Behaviors That Interfere with Receiving Therapy. The notion here is that 
a therapy applied but not received will fail. The idea is similar to the necessi­
ty of therapeutic blood levels for psychotropic medications. For DBT to be 
received, the patient must attend sessions, collaborate with the therapist, and 
comply with treatment recommendations. 
1. Nonattentive behaviors. Behaviors that interfere with attending to ther­
apy interfere with treatment effectiveness. Obviously, if a patient does not 
come to sessions or drops out prematurely, she will not benefit from therapy. 
Less obviously, if a patient comes to therapy physically but does not attend 
psychologically, it is difficult to understand how she will benefit from the ex­
perience. Attention-interfering behaviors that we have seen in our clinic are 
as foUows: dropping out of therapy; threatening to drop out of therapy; missing 
sessions; canceling sessions for nontherapeutic reasons; experiencing continu­
ous disruptive crises; getting admitted to hospitals excessively, and thus missing 
sessions; acting suicidal on inpatient units, and thus frightening the staff so 
that the patient cannot leave or receive a pass to come to individual or group 
therapy sessions; acting excessively suicidal or threatening suicide in the 
presence of people with legal power to commit the patient to a hospital (in­
voluntary patients usually cannot obtain passes to attend outpatient therapy 
sessions); taking mind-altering substances before coming to sessions (unless 
required to by prescription); walking out of sessions before they end; faint­
ing, having panic attacks, or having seizures during sessions; dissociating or 
daydreaming during sessions; and not getting sufficient sleep before sessions 
and coming too tired to stay awake. If these behaviors occur between one 
session and the next, or within the session, they are noted, and discussed, 
and relevant problem-solving strategies are applied. 
2. Non-collaborative behaviors. Behavior therapists have historically em­
phasized the role played by a collaborative and collegia! relationship between 
patient and therapist in therapeutic effectiveness, especially when treatments 
involve the patient's active participation within treatment sessions. Because 
direct modification of adults' environments is difficult or impossible, most 
behavioral treatment programs aimed at adults consist of some variation of 
self-management and skills training. Thus, therapists must teach adult pa­
tients how to modify their own environments so that functional behaviors 
and outcomes are enhanced. In such programs, patients' active collaboration 
is obviously essential. 
Alternatively, in treatments emphasizing the reinforcing functions of the 
therapist and focusing primarily on in-session patient behaviors, collabora­
tion may itself be a goal of treatment, rather than an essential patient be­
havior for achieving the goal. Such is the case with "functional analytic psy­
chotherapy," a radical behavioral treatment based on Skinnerian principles, 
developed by Robert Kohlenberg and Mavis Tsai (1991). Collaborative be­
haviors are viewed in DBT both as essential to treatment and as a goal of 
treatment. Noncollaborative behaviors are considered instances of therapy-
--- Page 152 ---
Behavioral Targets in Treatment 133 
interfering behaviors. Examples include the following: inability or refusal to 
work in therapy; lying; not talking at all in therapy; withdrawing emotional­
ly during sessions; arguing incessantly with anything and everything the ther­
apist says; distraaing and digressing from high-priority targets during sessions; 
and responding to most or all questions with "I don't know" or "I can't 
remember." 
3. Noncompliant behaviors. An active sense of participation by the pa­
tient in therapy is consistently related to positive outcome (Greenberg, 1983). 
Behavior therapy in general, and DBT in particular, require very direct in­
volvement of the patient in the treatment process. During sessions the pa­
tient may be required to engage in covert imaginal activities (e.g., relaxation 
training or systematic desensitization) or to practice new behaviors (e.g., role 
playing in social skills training), and also receives various homework assign­
ments between sessions. Patients are expected to expose themselves to situa­
tions they fear and to produce responses they find very difficult. Courage, 
self-management skills, and a history in which both compliance behaviors 
and active problem-solving attempts have been reinforced are requisites to such 
behaviors. Not surprisingly, borderline individuals often lack these attributes. 
Noncompliant behaviors include not fiUing out or not bringing in diary cards; 
filling them out incompletely or incorrealy; not keeping agreements made 
with the therapist; refusing to complete or only partially completing behavioral 
homework assignments; refusing to comply with treatment recommendations, 
such as exposure strategies; and refusing to agree to treatment goals essential 
to DBT (e.g., refusing to work on reducing suicidal behaviors). 
Behaviors That Interfere with Other Patients. In group and inpatient set­
tings, interactions among patients can be crucial to the success or failure of 
therapy. In my experience, the behaviors that are most likely to make other 
patients unable to profit from therapy are openly hostile, critical, and judg­
mental remarks directed to them. Although it may be desirable for the other 
patients to learn to tolerate such remarks, this goal seems impossible for some 
borderline patients to reach when they feel open to attack at any moment. 
Borderline patients are very sensitive to any type of negative feedback, even 
if only implied. They will often experience appropriately given feedback as 
an attack. A patient's inability to accept reasonably given negative feedback 
from other patients may itself be a therapy-interfering behavior, but ill-timed 
expressions of negative feelings toward another patient or insistent attempts 
at solving a relationship problem with another patient are usually also therapy-
interfering for the recipient. 
Since one of the interpersonal targets in DBT is to help patients become 
more comfortable with conflia, however, conflia avoidance is not always (or 
even usually) viewed as aaually desirable in DBT. Although almost any be­
havior that creates conflict may interfere with therapy for other patients, in 
my experience only openly hostile attacks on other patients threaten to des­
troy the possibility of therapy. 
--- Page 153 ---
134 TREATMENT OVERVIEW AND GOALS 
Behaviors That Burn Out Therapists. Borderline individuals want help 
from people in their environment, but often they either are unskilled at ask­
ing for and receiving help or burn out potential caregivers. Learning how to 
ask for and receive help appropriately, as well as how to care for the help 
giver, is an important life skill. A focus on enhancing help-requesting and 
help-receiving behaviors among borderline individuals, as well as the gener­
alization of these behaviors to everyday life, enhances the quality of both ther­
apy and everyday life. Of course, reducing behaviors that burn out therapists 
is also essential if a therapeutic relationship is to be maintained. Generally, 
research in this area suggests that burnout, once it occurs, can lead to a host 
of therapeutic mistakes (Chemiss, 1980; Carrol & White, 1981). It can be 
difficult to recover from. Thus, it seems important to prevent burnout rather 
than wait for it to occur and then try to remediate it. This same reasoning 
underlies the DBT strategy of observing limits, part of the contingency strate­
gies discussed in Chapter 10; I discuss this point in much greater detail there. 
Following from the above, the DBT individual therapist states clearly at 
the beginning that an important goal of DBT is to teach the patient to act 
in such a manner that the therapist not only can give the help that the patient 
needs, but also wants to do so. Generally, the therapist points out quickly 
that there is no such thing as unconditional positive regard or unconditional 
love. Even the most devoted person can be dissuaded from giving further help 
to a friend or relative; the same holds true for a therapist. Given the right 
behaviors, any patient can cause a therapist to reject her. This point is made 
very clear in the DBT therapy orientation, as Chapter 4 notes. The idea here 
is to cut off at the beginning any beliefs that the help the patient receives from 
the therapist is unrelated to her own interpersonal behaviors with the ther­
apist. In my experience, most borderline patients welcome such an orienta­
tion on the part of their therapists. Many have been rejected from therapy 
at least once. The idea that therapy will assist them in preventing this from 
happening again is welcome news. 
In my experience, therapists often have trouble identifying behaviors con­
tributing to burnout that qualify as therapy-interfering behaviors. Most have 
no difficulty identifying patients' behaviors that interfere with attending ther­
apy, collaborating with the therapists, and complying with treatment recom­
mendations. However, patients' behaviors that push therapists' personal limits 
or decrease their motivation to work with the patient's are often not identi­
fied. In these instances, many therapists tend to believe one of two things: 
Either the behaviors are part of the patients' "psychopathology," or the ther­
apists' reactions are somehow marks of their own inadequacy. When these 
behaviors are seen as part of "borderline pathology," they are often not tar­
geted direaly Many therapists seem to believe that if patients can be "cured" 
of their "borderlineness," these behaviors will automatically cease. Alterna­
tively, when a therapist's reactions are viewed as problems of the therapist, 
the patient's behaviors are often ignored in favor of focusing (usually in 
supervision or case conference meetings) on the inadequacies of the therapist. 
--- Page 154 ---
Behavioral Targets in Treatment 135 
1. Pushing the therapist's personal limits. Every therapist has personal 
limits both on what he or she is willing to do for a patient and on which 
patient behaviors are tolerable. Patient behaviors that exceed what the ther­
apist is willing to tolerate, therefore, are therapy-interfering behaviors. Which 
behaviors constitute pushing personal limits vary over therapists, over time, 
and over patients. Within the therapy of one patient, limits vary with changes 
in the therapeutic relationship and with individual factors in the therapist's 
ovra Hfe situation. Which behaviors are targeted at a given time depend both 
on the state of the therapist's limits at that time and on the capabilities of 
the patient. 
The most important limit-pushing behavior of any borderline patient is 
refusing to engage in or accept therapeutic strategies that the therapist be­
lieves are essential to progress or effective therapy. Thus, if a patient refuses 
to comply with a therapeutic strategy that the therapist believes is essential 
to effective therapy, and other reasonably acceptable strategies are not avail­
able, then that refusal is a limit-pushing behavior and therefore may become 
the focus of therapy untU it is resolved. The patient, the therapist, or both 
need to change. Other behaviors that can push the limits of a DBT therapist 
include phoning the therapist too much; going to the therapist's house or in­
itiating interactions with the therapist's family members; demanding solutions 
to problems that the therapist cannot solve; demanding more session time 
or more sessions than the therapist can deliver; interaaing with the ther­
apist in an overly personal or familiar way, including sexually provocative or 
seduaive behavior; infringing on the therapist's personal space; and threaten­
ing harm to the therapist or his or her family members. Almost any patient 
behavior can at times push some therapists' limits. Although at times limits 
must be stretched, there are no a priori personal limits that must be observed 
in DBT. Thus, limit-pushing behaviors can only be defined by each therapist 
in relation to each individual patient. Patients in a program where they inter­
act with multiple therapists, therefore, must learn to observe multiple sets 
of limits. 
Pushing a therapist's limits is often interpreted by nonbehavioral ther­
apists as an absence of patient boundaries. Patient behaviors that make a ther­
apist feel as if his or her personal boundaries are being intruded and infringed 
upon, and at times taken over, are assumed to be a result of the patient's hav­
ing no personal boundaries of her own. The term "boundaries" is used as 
if it has a nonarbitrary meaning, independent of the effect of the patient's 
behaviors on the therapist. A therapist often sets such boundaries as if there 
is a "correct" placement for them. In my view, however, boundary setting is 
a social function; thus, there are no context-free, correa boundaries. The 
relevant task that a borderline patient often cannot or will not engage in is 
that of observing and respeaing other people's interpersonal boundaries. Such 
failures may be determined by any number of factors other than the patient's 
sense of her own boundaries. 
Focusing on the patient's own boundaries (instead of the infringement 
--- Page 155 ---
136 TREATMENT OVERVIEW AND GOALS 
of the therapist's), however, has two unfortunate outcomes from a DBT point 
of view. First, it defleas the therapist from attention to the patient's problemat­
ic behavior. To change a construa, such as boundaries, requires at least that 
the therapist be able to specify the behaviors that operationally define the con-
stma; this is rarely done. Second, since lack of boundaries is assumed to deter­
mine the problematic behaviors, there is little or no incentive to conduct a be­
havioral analysis to probe for other influences. Thus, important faaors deter­
mining the behavior may be missed, making change that much more difficult. 
2. Behaviors that push organizational limits. Although we do not or­
dinarily think of organizations, including treatment units, as having "personal 
limits," it is useful to consider limits from this perspeaive in DBT. Thus, in­
patient unit rules (e.g., no loud radios), elements of day treatment contraas 
(e.g., no guns), or outpatient clinic rules (e.g., waiting for therapists in the 
designated waiting area) are instances of organizational limits. They are "per­
sonal" because each treatment unit has its own set of limits, often developed 
to satisfy many individuals (hospital and unit administrators, legal person­
nel, unit direaors, etc.). For example, in my program, patients cross a limit 
when they do anything that might get my treatment unit kicked out of the 
larger clinic that gives us space. The only requirement in DBT is that the limits 
of organizations offering therapy should mimic as closely as possible organiza­
tional limits in everyday settings. Thus, limits requiring deferential or sub­
missive behaviors, or proscribing interpersonal behaviors that would be 
tolerated in ordinary work, school, or home settings, are probably iatrogenic. 
In DBT, behaviors that cross organizational limits are treated in the same 
fashion as those that cross a therapist's limits. In both cases, the therapist 
must make it clear that the limits reflect the personality of the individual or 
the organization. 
As in the case of a therapist's personal limits, a most important type of 
organizational limit has to do with the treatment unit's bottom-line require­
ments for conduaing effective treatment. This type of limit comes the closest 
to an arbitrary limit, since it is constructed with a class of patients in mind 
(e.g., borderline patients), without considering the needs of any particular 
patient. For example, in the first year of standard DBT, all patients are re­
quired to be in both individual psychotherapy and some sort of structured 
skills training. On many inpatient units, all patients are required to take part 
in a specified number of unit aaivities or therapy groups. In a research treat­
ment setting, all patients may be required to participate in periodic assess­
ments. The key here is for the unit to be very careful in developing these limits, 
keeping only those that everyone is sure are necessary for the treatment pro­
gram to work. 
3. Behaviors that decrease the therapist's motivation. A prerequisite to 
continuation of therapy is motivation to continue on the part of both ther­
apist and patient. Motivation, in turn, is dependent on reinforcement history 
in a particular situation or context. In the best of cases, the patient's progress 
toward treatment goals is the primary reinforcer for the therapist; when 
--- Page 156 ---
Behavioral Targets in Treatment 137 
progress is slow, other behaviors of the patient can assume greater impor­
tance. The unwUlingness of many therapists to work with borderline patients 
is directly tied to the relative absence of reinforcing behaviors from these pa­
tients and to the presence of many behaviors that the therapists experience 
as aversive. FaUure to attend to therapy, noncollaborative behaviors, noncom­
pliance, and pushing the therapist's limits all qualify here. Other behaviors 
I have experienced include a hostile attitude; impatience and statements that 
the therapist should do better or is not a good therapist, especially when these 
are sarcastic or caustic; criticisms of the therapist's person or personality; criti­
cisms of the therapist's values, place of work, or family; lack of gratitude or 
appreciation of the therapist's efforts; inability or unwillingness to see or ad­
mit progress that does occur; and comparisons of the therapist to others who 
are viewed as better therapists. Particularly stressful patient behaviors are 
threats to sue the therapist, reporting the therapist to the licensing board, or 
otherwise engaging in a public rebuke of the therapist. One patient in our 
clinic brought and sent her therapist an overwhelming number of letters, es­
says, poems, drawings, and gifts. The therapist once took home an essay to 
read and somehow misplaced it. The patient at a later date asked for it back, 
and when informed that the therapist had misplaced it at home, she took 
the therapist to small-claims court to request damages of several hundred dol­
lars. Needless to say, the therapist was not highly motivated to continue ther­
apy with the patient even after she located the missing essay. 
4. Behaviors that reduce milieu or group members'motivation. In group, 
mUieu, and family therapy, the typical expectation is that patients or family 
members will assist one another. In this sense, each patient and family mem­
ber can also be considered a therapist. Any individual behaviors that decrease 
the motivation of other group, milieu, or family members to continue offer­
ing help and stay interested in the patient's welfare are therapy-interfering be­
haviors. 
Therapy-Enhancing Behaviors of the Patient 
During the initial orientation to DBT, and sometimes frequently thereafter, 
I make it clear to patients that one of their tasks is to interact with me in 
such a way that I want to continue working with them. (I have a similar 
reciprocal obligation to them.) This idea is often a new one to our patients. 
Of course, during interactions with a patient, a therapist has an obligation 
to act in helpful ways no matter what the patient is doing. If this is not pos­
sible, then the interactions should be terminated. To prevent such an 
outcome —for example, losing phone calls or therapy altogether—the patient 
is taught the specific behaviors that will enhance the likelihood of interac­
tion's continuing. 
As noted above, the chief therapy-enhancing behavior is simply making 
progress toward behavioral goals. Behaviors important to therapists, besides 
the converse of the therapy-interfering behaviors described above, are specif-
--- Page 157 ---
138 TREATMENT OVERVIEW AND GOALS 
ic to each therapist and vary with context. Those that have been important 
to me and therapists I work with consist of asking for help in avoiding sui­
cide or parasuicide (rather than threatening suicide or parasuicide if help is 
not given); trying out behavioral suggestions given by the therapist (rather 
than saying that they will not work); asking whether this is a convenient time 
to talk when calling the therapist, and taking no for an answer when neces­
sary; accepting with good grace a phone call shorter than desired; keeping 
agreements made to the therapist; calling to cancel appointments (rather than 
simply not showing up); and showing a sense of humor, or at least apprecia­
tion of the therapist's sense of humor. The key point I want to make is that 
therapy-enhancing behaviors must often be taught, not expected. 
Therapy-Interfering Behaviors of the Therapist 
Therapy-interfering behaviors on the part of the therapist include any that 
are iatrogenic, as well as any that unnecessarily cause the patient distress or 
make progress difficult. The basic idea here is that the therapist should, first, 
do no harm. Second, all other things being equal, the therapist should im­
plement the most benign therapy possible. Third, the therapist should be non-
defensive about mistakes and flexibly open to repairing and changing response 
patterns when necessary. 
A broad array of factors may increase therapist-interfering behaviors. 
Those that have consistently influenced me and others in my clinic include 
the following: personal factors, such as life stress at home or at work, not 
enough sleep, or illness; too many time demands other than those created 
by the patient; compartmentalizing clinical work into a smaU part of the week, 
so that clinical demands at other times are experienced as intrusive (a partic­
ular problem for those in the academic world); insecurity about one's skills 
as a therapist, especially in comparison to other therapists on the team; com­
parisons of the patient's seeming lack of progress to the progress everyone 
else's patients seem to be making; anger, hostility, and frustration directed 
at the patient; "blaming the viaim" attitudes, especially if one cannot remem­
ber another way to think about the patient's behavior; a sense of being pushed 
up against the wall by the patient, or of losing control of the therapy situa­
tion; fear of being sued; anxiety and/or panic that the patient will commit 
suicide; and unrealistic beliefs about what is possible in the moment, with 
corresponding unreasonable expectations of the patient. 
One of the most common, and most debilitating, factors leading to ther­
apeutic mistakes is a therapist's inability to tolerate a patient's communica­
tions of suffering in the present. Attempts to ameliorate patient suffering often 
lead to reinforcements of dysfunctional behaviors, which, rather than reduc­
ing suffering, aaually inaease it in the long run; this point has been discussed 
in more detaU in Chapter 4. Therapists' therapy-interfering behaviors, however, 
can be generally classified into two categories: (1) those that concern balance 
within the therapy delivery, and (2) those that concern respect for the patient.

Behaviors Creating Therapeutic Imbalance. Typically, behaviors that im­
balance the therapy are consistent behaviors located at one extreme or the 
other (e.g., acceptance vs. change or stability vs. flexibility) of a continuum 
of therapist behaviors. 
1. Imbalance of change versus acceptance. From a DBT perspective, the 
worst offenders of this sort are behavior patterns that create and maintain 
a lack of balance between change and acceptance treatment strategies. A ther­
apist who is overly focused on change may so invalidate the patient's sense 
of herself and her view of reality that years may be spent in subsequent ther­
apies undoing the damage. A patient who rebels in such an environment may 
be blamed as excessively defensive, and her objections may go unheeded. In 
contrast, a therapist who accepts the patient unconditionally, but does not 
teach her new, more competent behavior patterns, does the patient little good. 
Indeed, such an approach rarely accepts the patient's own view of what she 
needs for change to occur. It is a rare borderline patient who is not eager 
for behavioral coaching, especially in situations she finds difficult or impos­
sible to handle. 
2. Imbalance of flexibility versus stability. A second group of therapy-
interfering behaviors consists of those indicating an inability to balance flex­
ibUity in modifying treatment approaches with stability of therapeutic focus. 
Such a problem most often occurs with the therapist who, without a theoret­
ical perspective to guide therapy, switches strategies endlessly in an effort to 
achieve some behavioral progress. Essentially, the problem is one of patience. 
Almost any therapeutic strategy with a borderline patient takes a fair amount 
of time to succeed. Equally problematic is a therapist's modification of ther­
apy according to non-theory-linked criteria. Examples include skipping skills 
training in favor of "heart-to-heart" discussions when the therapist is bored 
or not "in the mood" for the effort imposed by skUls training; locking a pa­
tient in a hospital out of anger or to appease family members, rather than 
as a theory-Hnked response to the patient's suicide crisis behavior; or appeasing 
the patient because the therapist is too tired or does not have time to cope 
with conflict. Needless to say, trying to convince the patient that these ther­
apeutic behaviors are for the patient's own good simply compounds the 
problem. At the other pole, rigidly maintaining therapeutic strategies that 
produce no progress or extreme distress for the patient, especially if other 
potentially therapeutic strategies are avaUable, is also therapy-interfering. Un­
fortunately, aU humans become more rigid under stress—a condition that often 
accompanies treating the borderline patient. In my experience, under the stress 
of treating difficult patients, therapists often vaciUate between being too rigid 
and stubborn and being too flexible. Keeping a balance between stability and 
flexibUity depends on ongoing therapeutic assessment and application of the 
interventions described in great detail in Chapters 8-11. 
3. Imbalance of nurturing versus demanding change. A third type of im­
balance is that between nurturing and doing for the patient on one hand. 
--- Page 159 ---
140 TREATMENT OVERVIEW AND GOALS 
and withholding help on the other, assuming that the patient will help her­
self when she is sufficiently motivated. In the first case, the patient is seen 
as excessively fragile, incompetent, and too vulnerable to help herself. The 
therapist may infantilize the patient, treat her as unable to make decisions, 
and do things for and help her in ways that the therapist would not consider 
for other patients. Out of context, examples of this may include regularly 
meeting the patient in a coffee shop for sessions because the patient is viewed 
as too afraid to come to the office; taking her places (or ignoring missed ses­
sions) because she is unable to drive and is believed too fragile to learn to 
ride public transportation; changing difficult topics; believing that the pa­
tient is too intimidated to speak for herself and allowing her to be silent while 
answering for her in a family meeting; and taking charge of her money and 
paying bills for her. In contrast, a therapist at times may refuse to accept that 
a patient needs more support and nurturing than she is receiving—a stance 
that insures failure. At times the patient may actually exaggerate her needs 
and incompetence to make the therapist take her seriously, thus continuing 
the cycle of failure. Difficulties in keeping a balance between intervening for 
and taking care of a patient versus consulting with and teaching her how to 
care for herself are discussed extensively in Chapter 13. 
4. Imbalance of reciprocal versus irreverent communication. Therapists 
also err when they lose their balance between reciprocal and irreverent com­
munication (see Chapters 4 and 12). On the one hand, borderline patients 
seem to encourage vulnerability and personal sharing on the part of their ther­
apists. Two factors operate here. First, borderline patients can be quite per­
suasive in their arguments that the therapeutic relationship is artificially 
unegalitarian and one-sided. "Why should I be the one taking all the risks?" 
they may ask. Second, borderline individuals are often extremely capable 
caregivers; thus, all too often, therapists make the mistake of becoming over­
ly vulnerable within the therapy. It is not unusual for therapists to develop 
the habit of sharing their own personal trials and tribulations with border­
line patients, regardless of their relevance to the patients' therapy. Sexual in­
volvement with a patient is the most exaggerated example here. At the other 
extreme, therapists can overemphasize the distance between themselves and 
their patients. Non-DBT therapists justify this by referring to "boundary is­
sues" or the "therapeutic frame." DBT therapists can resort to irreverent com­
munication strategies. Irreverent communication, therapeutic frames, and 
boundary issues, however, can all be distorted to condone cruel jokes at pa­
tients' expense; hostUe aiticism; unwarranted attacks on patients' beliefs, emo­
tional responses, decisions, and behavior; and inflexible emotional and 
physical distancing from patients. 
Behaviors Showing Lack of Respect for the Patient. Behaviors that com­
municate lack of respect to a patient sometimes communicate accurately. At 
other times they are inadvertent, resulting more from thoughtiessness than 
from genuine lack of respect. Typical disrespectful behaviors of therapists are

Hsted in Table 5.1; this list was put together from a number of resources 
by Marian Miller (1990). Many of the behaviors listed here are indicative 
of therapist burnout, either in general or with a particular patient. Although 
an occasional instance of behavior communicating lack of respect is perhaps 
not very detrimental to therapy, an accumulation over time can interfere seri­
ously with the therapeutic endeavor. Even more crucial than avoiding dis-
respeaful behaviors, however, is the therapist's response when such behaviors 
are pointed out by the patient. The task of repairing disruptions and tears 
in the fabric of the relationship can be one of the most therapeutic processes 
the patient experiences. Certainly the necessity to repair relationships is typical 
in the patient's life; the repair in this case, however, can prove extraordinar­
ily healing. 
Decreasing Behaviors That interfere with Quality of Life 
As I have indicated in Chapter 4 and again in this chapter, DBT assumes 
that borderline patients have good reasons for being suicidal and unhappy. 
--- Page 161 ---
142 TREATMENT OVERVIEW AND GOALS 
The solution, from my point of view, is for the patients to change the quality 
of their lives. Behaviors that might be categorized as interfering wdth the quality 
of life are listed in Table 5.2. The list is not exhaustive, and other problems 
may surface with a particular patient. To be included in this category, a pa­
tient's behavior must be seriously problematic—enough so that if not changed, 
it surely will interfere with any chance of a reasonable quality of life. A good 
way to determine whether the behavior pattern is serious enough to qualify 
here is to consider the pattern both in terms of DSM-IV diagnostic criteria 
(in particular. Axes I and V) and in terms of the effects of the behavior on 
the patient's ability to progress further in therapy. Behavioral patterns that 
are not serious enough to meet diagnostic criteria, cause serious impairment, 
or interfere with the further condua of therapy do not quaHfy under this head­
ing. Instead, less serious or less harmful patterns should be treated in the sec­
ond and third stages of DBT. 
Usually, the determination of which behavior patterns meet this criteria 
will be made by therapist and patient jointly. However, in many instances, 
TABLE 5.2. Behaviors That interfere with Quality of Life 
1. Substance abuse (examples: alcohol drinking; abuse of illicit or prescription drugs) 
2. High-risk or unprotected sexual behavior (examples: unsafe sex practices; abus­
ing others sexually; excessively promiscuous sex; sex with inappropriate persons) 
3. Extreme financial difficulties (examples: overwhelming unpaid bills; difficulties 
in budgeting; excessive spending or gambling; inability to manage public assistance 
agencies) 
4. Criminal behaviors that if not changed may lead to jail (examples: shoplifting; 
setting fires) 
5. Serious dysfunaional interpersonal behaviors (examples: choosing or staying with 
physically, sexually, and/or emotionally abusive partners; excessive contact with 
abusive relatives; ending relationships prematurely; making other people feel so 
uncomfortable that few friends are possible; incapacitating shyness or fear of 
social disapproval) 
6. Employment- or school-related dysfunctional behaviors (examples: quitting jobs 
or school prematurely; inability to look for or find a job; fear of going to school 
or getting needed vocational training; difficulties in doing job or school-related 
work; inappropriate career choices; getting fired or failing in school excessively) 
7. Illness-related dysfunctional behaviors (examples: inability to get proper medi­
cal care; not taking necessary medications; overtaking medication; fear of phy­
sicians; refusal to treat illness) 
8. Housing-related dysfunctional behaviors (examples: living in shelters, in cars, 
or in overcrowded housing; living with abusive or incompatible people; not finding 
stable housing; engaging in behaviors that cause eviaions or rejeaions from hous­
ing possibilities) 
9. Mental-health-related dysfunctional behaviors (examples: going into psychiatric 
hospitals; pharmacotherapist hopping; not finding needed ancillary treatments) 
10. Mental-disorder-related dysfunctional patterns (examples: behavioral patterns 
that meet criteria for other severe or debilitating Axis I or Axis II mental disorders) 
--- Page 162 ---

the recognition that a particular behavior pattern is problematic is the first 
step on the path to change. In such instances, the therapist must be very care­
ful to keep the focus on behaviors that indeed are functionally related to 
quality-of-life issues for the particular patient. Opinions and personalized judg­
ments can often interfere here (instances of therapy-interfering behaviors by 
the therapist). 
Case conferences and supervisory sessions can be invaluable for helping 
a therapist sort through his or her own values, differences between these and 
the patient's values, and the influence of the therapist's values on therapeutic 
priorities. Such sorting through is especially important when a therapist and 
patient come from differing cultural backgrounds. Whether or not a ther­
apist can work within the context of the patient's values, however, depends 
on the therapist's ovm personal limits. For example, I once had a patient who 
set fires in postal pickup boxes. She did not view this as a high-priority 
problem. When we were negotiating for a second year of therapy, I told her 
that I could not work with her unless one goal of therapy was to stop this 
behavior. I did not want to tolerate my images of the patient's getting arrest­
ed or other people's not getting important letters. 
One basic premise of DBT is that a structured lifestyle is functionally 
related to therapeutic gains across all target areas. In an early version of DBT, 
I required patients to have struaured aaivities that took them out of their 
homes at least part of each week, preferably daily. Such activities could con­
sist of employment, volunteer jobs, school, or other obligations. The reason 
for this requirement was that my coUeagues and I found it difficult (if not 
impossible) to have an effea on borderline patients' mood-dependent behaviors 
if the patients stayed home all day. Generally, staying home was related to 
increasing depressive affea, escalating fear and agoraphobia-like behaviors, 
behavioral passivity, and increased suicidal behaviors. I changed this require­
ment to a recommendation in subsequent versions of the treatment; the rea­
son this had to do with the DBT policy on termination of treatment. Generally, 
the approach is to avoid unilateral termination of therapy, if at all possible. 
Termination is not only the most powerful but also the last contingency avail­
able to the therapist, and we found that it had to be used too often when 
structured activities were required. The current policy is to make dysfunc­
tional behaviors as uncomfortable as possible within the treatment. Condi­
tions that can lead to termination of DBT are discussed further in Chapter 10. 
Increasing Behavioral Skills 
SkUls training in DBT is designed to remediate behavioral skill deficits typi­
cal of individuals meeting criteria for BPD. As Chapter 1 has suggested (see 
especially Table 1.5), the nine criteria for BPD designated in DSM-IV can 
be coUapsed reasonably well into five categories: self dysfunaion (inadequate 
sense of self, sense of emptiness); behavioral dysregulation (impulsive, self-
damaging, and/or suicidal behaviors); emotional dysregulation (emotional

lability, problems with anger); interpersonal dysregulation (chaotic relation­

dissociation, delusion). The behavioral skills taught in DBT target these 
problem areas. The relationship of DBT skills training to the broad categories 
of BPD criteria is outlined in Table 5.3. Emotion regulation skiUs, interper­
sonal effectiveness skills, distress tolerance skills, and DBT "core" mindful­
ness skills are taught in a structured format. Self-management skills, which 
are needed for learning all other skills, are taught as needed throughout the 
treatment. 
Core Mindfulness Skills 
Mindfulness skills are central to DBT; they are so important that they are 
referred to as "core" skUls. They are the first skills taught and are listed on 
the diary cards that patients fill out every week. The skills are psychological 
and behavioral versions of meditation skiUs usually taught in Eastem spiritual 
practices. 1 have drawn most heavily from the praaice of Zen, but the skills 
are compatible with most Westem contemplative and Eastem meditation prac­
tices. There are three "what" skiUs (observing, describing, participating) and 
three "how" skills (taking a nonjudgmental stance, focusing on one thing in 
the moment, being effective). These skills are outiined and described in great 
detail in the companion manual to this volume; a brief summary is given 
below. 
Core "Whats." The mindftilness "what" skills include leaming to ob­
serve, to describe, and to participate. The goal is to develop a lifestyle of par­
ticipating with awareness; it is assumed that participation without awareness 
is a key characteristic of impulsive and mood-dependent behaviors. General-
--- Page 164 ---

ly, aaively observing and describing one's own behavioral responses are only 
necessary when new behavior is being learned, there is some sort of problem, 
or a change is necessary. For example, beginning piano players pay close at­
tention to the location of their hands and fingers, and may either count beats 
out loud or name the keys and chords they are playing. As skill improves, 
however, such observing and describing cease. But if a habitual mistake is 
made after a piece is learned, the player may have to revert to observing and 
describing untU a new pattern has been learned. 
The first "what" skill is observing—that is, attending to events, emo­
tions, and other behavioral responses, even if these are distressing ones. What 
the patient learns here is simply to allow herself to experience with aware­
ness, in the moment, whatever is happening, rather than leaving a situation 
or trying to terminate an emotion, (behaviors discussed below as among those 
that must be decreased). Generally, the ability to attend to events requires 
a corresponding ability to step back from the event; observing an event is 
separate or different from the event itselL (Observing walking and walking 
are two different responses, for example.) This focus on "experiencing the 
moment" is based on both eastern psychological approaches and Western no­
tions of nonreinforced exposure as a method of extinguishing automatic 
avoidance and fear responses. 
The second "what" skiU is that of describing events and personal responses 
in words. The ability to apply verbal labels to behavioral and environmental 
events is essential for both communication and self-control. Learning to 
describe requires that the individual learn not to take her emotions and 
thoughts literally—that is, as literal reflections of environmental events. For 
example, feeling afraid does not necessarily mean that a situation is threatening 
to one's life or welfare. However, borderline individuals often confuse emo­
tional responses with precipitating events. Physical components of fear (e.g., 
"I feel my stomach muscles tightening and my throat constricting") may be 
confused with perceptions of the environment ("I am starting an exam in 
school") to produce a thought ("I am going to fail the exam"). Thoughts also 
are often taken literaUy; that is, thoughts ("I feel unloved") are confused with 
facts ("I am unloved"). Indeed, one of the principal aims of cognitive therapy 
is to test the association of thoughts with their corresponding environmental 
events. The individual who cannot identify thoughts as thoughts, outside 
events as events, and so on, will have great difficulty in most treatment ap­
proaches. Interestingly, almost every therapeutic approach stresses the impor­
tance of helping the patient observe and describe events. Free association in 
psychoanalysis; keeping behavioral diaries in behavior therapy; recording 
thoughts, assumptions, and beliefs in cognitive therapy; and reflective respond­
ing in client-centered therapy are all instances of the patient's or the therapist's 
observing and describing behavioral responses and ongoing events in the pa­
tient's life. 
The third core "what" skill is the ability to participate without self-
consciousness. "Participating" in this sense is entering completely into the ac-
--- Page 165 ---
146 TREATMENT OVERVIEW AND GOALS 
tivities of the current moment, without separating oneself from ongoing events 
and interactions. The quality of action is spontaneous; the interaction be­
tween the individual and the environment is smooth and based in part, but 
not by any means entirely, on habit. Participating can, of course, be mind­
less. We have all had the experience of driving a complicated route home as 
we concentrated on something else, arriving home without any awareness 
whatsoever of how we got there. But it can also be mindful. A good example 
of mindful participating is that of the skillful athlete who responds flexibly 
but smoothly to the demands of the task with alertness and awareness, but 
not with self-consciousness. Mindlessness is participating without attention 
to the task; mindfulness is participating with attention. 
Core "Hows." The next three mindfulness skills have to do with how 
one observes, describes, and participates; they include taking a nonjudgmen­
tal stance, focusing on one thing in the moment, and being effeaive (doing 
what works). As taught in DBT, taking a nonjudgmental stance means just 
that—judging something as neither good nor bad. It does not mean going 
from a negative judgment to a positive judgment. Although borderline in­
dividuals tend to judge both themselves and others in either excessively posi­
tive terms (idealization) or excessively negative terms (devaluation), the 
position here is not that they should be more balanced in their judgments, 
but rather that judging should in most instances be dropped altogether. This 
is a very subtle point but a very important one. The notion is that, for in­
stance, a person who can be "worthwhile" can always become "worthless." 
Instead, DBT stresses a focus on the consequences of behaviors and events. 
For example, behaviors may lead to painful consequences for oneself or for 
others, or the outcome of events may be destructive. A nonjudgmental ap­
proach observes these consequences, and may suggest changing the behaviors 
or events, but does not necessarily add a label of "bad" to them. Everything 
simply is as it is. Or, as Albert Ellis is reputed to have said when asked how 
a rational-emotive therapist would handle the prospea of an imminent plane 
crash, "If you die, you die." 
Mindfulness in its totality has to do with the quality of awareness that 
a person brings to activities. The second "how" goal is to learn to focus the 
mind and awareness on the current moment's aaivity, rather than splitting 
attention among several aaivities or between a current activity and thoughts 
about something else. Achieving such a focus requires control of attention, 
a capability that most borderline patients lack. Often borderline patients are 
distraaed by thoughts and images of the past, worries about the future, 
ruminative thoughts about troubles, or current negative moods. Rather than 
focusing their entire attention on current worries (which would be an instance 
of mindful worrying) and perhaps resolving some aspect of a current worry, 
they often worry while at the same time trying to do something else. This 
problem is readily observable in their difficulties in attending to the DBT skills 
training program. The patients must be taught how to focus their attention 
--- Page 166 ---
Behavioral Targets in Treatment 147 
on one task or activity at a time, engaging in it with alertness, awareness, 
and wakefulness. 
The third "how" goal, being effective, is directed at reducing the patients' 
tendency at times to be more concerned with what is "right" than with doing 
what is actually needed or called for in a particular situation. Being effective 
is the opposite of "cutting off your nose to spite your face." As our patients 
often say, it is "playing the game" or "doing what works." From an Eastern 
meditation perspeaive, focusing on effeaiveness is "using skillful means." The 
inability to let go of "being right" in favor of achieving goals is, of course, 
related to borderline patients' experiences with invalidating environments. A 
central issue for many patients is whether they can indeed trust their own 
perceptions, judgments, and decisions —that is, whether they can expea their 
own actions to be correa or "right." However, taken to an extreme, an em­
phasis on principle over outcome can often result in borderline patients' be­
ing disappointed or alienating others. In the end, we all have to "give in" some 
of the time. Borderline patients at times find it much easier to give up being 
right for being effective when it is viewed as a skillful response rather than 
as a "giving in." 
Distress Tolerance Skills 
DBT emphasizes learning to bear pain skillfully. The ability to tolerate and 
accept distress is an essential mental health goal for at least two reasons. First, 
pain and distress are part of life; they cannot be entirely avoided or removed. 
The inability to accept this immutable faa leads itself to increased pain and 
suffering. Second, distress tolerance, at least over the short run, is part and 
parcel of any attempt to change oneself; otherwise, impulsive actions will in­
terfere with efforts to establish desired changes. 
Distress tolerance skills constitute a natural progression from mindful­
ness skiUs. They have to do with the ability to accept, in a nonjudgmental 
fashion, both oneself and one's current situation. Essentially, distress toler­
ance is the ability to perceive one's environment without putting demands 
on it to be different; to experience one's current emotional state without at­
tempting to change it; and to observe one's own thoughts and aaion pat­
tems without attempting to stop or control them. Although the stance 
advocated here is a nonjudgmental one, this should not be taken to mean 
that it is one of approval. It is especially important that this distinction be 
made clear to the patient: Acceptance of reality is not equivalent to approval 
of reality. Or, as a cognftive restruauring therapist might put it, "The fact 
that something is not a catastrophe does not mean it is not a pain in the ass." 
The distress tolerance behaviors tai^eted in DBT are concemed with toler­
ating and surviving crises and with accepting life as it is in the moment. Four 
sets of crisis survival strategies are taught: distracting (with activities, doing 
things that contribute, comparing oneself to people less well off, opposite 
emotions, pushing away painful situations, other thoughts, and intense other

sensations), self-soothing (via vision, hearing, smell, taste, and touch), im­
proving the moment (with imagery, meaning, prayer, relaxation, focusing on 
one thing in the moment, taking vacations, and self-encouragement), and 
thinking of pros and cons. Acceptance skills include radical acceptance (i.e., 
complete acceptance from deep within), turning the mind toward acceptance 
(i.e., choosing to accept reality as it is), and willingness versus wUlfulness. 
The idea of "willingness" is Gerald May's (1982); he describes it as foUows. 
Willingness implies a surrendering of one's self-separateness, an entering into, 
an immersion in the deepest processes of life itself. It is a realization that one 
already is a part of some ultimate cosmic process and it is a commitment to par­
ticipation in that process. In contrast, willfulness is the setting of oneself apart 
from the fundamental essence of life in an attempt to master, direct, control, 
or otherwise manipulate existence. More simply, willingness is saying yes to the 
mystery of being alive in each moment. Willfulness is saying no, or perhaps more 
commonly, "yes, but. . ." (p. 6) 
Although borderline patients and their therapists alike readUy accept crisis 
survival skills as important, the DBT focus on acceptance and willingness 
is often viewed as inherently flawed. This viewpoint is based on the notion 
that acceptance and willingness imply approval. This is not what May (1982) 
means; indeed, he points out that willingness demands opposition to des­
tructive forces, but goes on to note that it seems almost inevitable that this 
opposition often turns into willfulness: 
But willingness and willfulness do not apply to specific things or situations. They 
reflect instead the underlying attitude one has toward the wonder of life itself. 
Willingness notices this wonder and bows in some kind of reverence to it. Will­
fulness forgets it, ignores it, or at its worst, actively tries to destroy it. Thus will­
ingness can sometimes seem very active and assertive, even aggressive. And 
willfulness can appear in the guise of passivity. Political revolution is a good ex­
ample, (p. 6) 
Emotion Regulation Skills 
Borderline individuals are affectively intense and labile. As noted in Chapter 
1, many studies have suggested that borderline and parasuicidal individuals 
are characterized by anger, intense frustration, depression, and anxiety; as 
noted in Chapter 2, DBT postulates that difficulties in regulating painful emo­
tions are central to the behavioral difficulties of the borderline individual. 
From the patient's perspeaive, painful feelings are most often the "problem 
to be solved." Suicidal behaviors and other dysfunctional behaviors, includ­
ing substance abuse, are often behavioral solutions to intolerably painful 
emotions. 
Such affeaive intensity and labUity suggest that borderiine patients might 
benefit from help in leaming to regulate their affective levels. In my experience, 
most borderline individuals try to regulate affect by simply giving themselves 
--- Page 168 ---
Behavioral Targets in Treatment 149 
instructions not to feel whatever it is that they feel. This tendency is a direct 
result of the emotional invalidating environment, which mandates that peo­
ple should smile when they are unhappy, be nice and not rock the boat when 
they are angry, and confess and feel forgiven when they are feeling guilty. 
Affect regulation skills can be extremely difficult to teach, because bor­
derline individuals have often been overdosed with instruaions that if they 
would just "change their attitude" they could change their feelings. In a sense, 
many borderline individuals come from environments where everyone else ex­
hibits almost perfect cognitive control of their emotions. Moreover, these very 
same individuals have exhibited intolerance and strong disapproval of the pa­
tients' inability to exhibit similar control. Often borderline patients will resist 
any attempt to control their emotions; such control would imply that other 
people are right and they are wrong for feeling the way they do. Thus, affect 
regulation can be taught only in a context of emotional self-validation. 
Like distress tolerance, affea regulation requires the application of mind­
fulness skills—in this case, the nonjudgmental observation and description 
of one's current emotional responses. The theoretical idea is that much of 
the borderline individual's emotional distress is a result of secondary responses 
(e.g., intense shame, anxiety, or rage) to primary emotions. Often the primary 
emotions are adaptive and appropriate to the context. The reduction of this 
secondary distress requires exposure to the primary emotions in a nonjudg­
mental atmosphere. In this context, mindfulness to one's own emotional 
responses can be thought of as an exposure technique. There are a number 
of specific DBT emotion regulation skills, described below. 
Identifying and Labeling Affect. The first step in regulating emotions 
is leaming to identify and label ongoing, curtent emotions. Emotions, however, 
are complex behavioral responses. Their identification often involves the abUity 
not only to observe one's own responses, but also to describe accurately the 
context in which the emotions occur. Thus, learning to identify an emotion­
al response is aided enormously if one can observe and describe (1) the event 
prompting the emotion; (2) the interpretations of the event that prompt the 
emotion; (3) the phenemonological experience, including physical sensation, 
of the emotion; (4) the expressive behaviors associated with the emotion; and 
(5) the aftereffects of the emotion on one's own functioning. 
Identifying Obstacles to Changing Emotions. Emotional behavior is 
funaional to the individual. Changing emotional behaviors can be difficult 
when they are followed by reinforcing consequences; thus, identifying the func­
tions and reinforcers for particular emotional behaviors can be useful. Gener­
ally, emotions function to communicate to others and to motivate a person's 
own behavior. Emotional behaviors can also have two other important func­
tions. The first, related to the communication function, is to influence and 
control other people's behaviors; the second is to validate the person's own 
perceptions and interpretations of events. Although the latter function is not 
--- Page 169 ---
150 TREATMENT OVERVIEW AND GOALS 
fully logical (e.g., if one person hates another, this does not necessarily mean 
that the other is worthy of being hated), it can nonetheless be important for 
borderline patients. Identifying these funaions of emotions, especially nega­
tive emotions, is an important step toward change. 
Reducing Vulnerability to "Emotion Mind." All people are more sus­
ceptible to emotional reaaivity when they are under physical or environmen­
tal stress. Accordingly, patients are assisted in achieving balanced nutrition 
and eating habits, getting sufficient but not too much sleep (including treat­
ing insomnia if needed), getting adequate exercise, treating physical Ulnesses, 
staying off nonprescribed mood-altering drugs, and increasing mastery by en­
gaging in activities that build a sense of self-efficacy and competence. The 
focus on mastery is very similar to activity scheduling in cognitive therapy 
for depression (Beck et al., 1979). Although these targets seem straight for­
ward, making headway on them with borderline patients can be exhausting 
for both patients and therapists. With respea to insomnia, many of our bor­
derline patients fight a never-ending battle in which pharmacotherapy often 
seems of little help. Poverty can interfere with both balanced nutrition and 
medical care. Work on any of these targets requires an aaive stance by the 
patients and persistence until positive effeas begin to accumulate. The typi­
cal problem-solving passivity of many borderline patients can be a substan­
tial difficulty here. 
Increasing Positive Emotional Events. Once again, DBT assumes that 
most people, including borderline individuals, feel bad for good reasons. 
Although people's perceptions tend to be distorted when they are highly emo­
tional, that does not mean that the emotions themselves are the result of dis­
torted perceptions. Thus, an important way to control emotions is to control 
the events that set off emotions. Increasing the number of positive events in 
one's life is one approach to increasing positive emotions. In the short term, 
this involves increasing daily positive experiences. In the long term, it means 
making life changes so that positive events wiU occur more often. In addition 
to increasing positive events, it is also useful to work on being mindful of 
positive experiences when they occur, as well as unmindful of worries that 
the positive experience will end. 
Increasing Mindfulness to Current Emotion. Mindfulness to current 
emotions means experiencing emotions without judging them or trying to 
inhibit them, block them, or distract from them. The basic idea here is that 
exposure to painful or distressing emotions, without association to negative 
consequences, will extinguish their ability to stimulate secondary negative 
emotions. The natural consequences of a patient's judging negative emotions 
as "bad" are feelings of guilt, anger, and/or anxiety whenever she feels "bad." 
The addition of these feelings to an already negative situation simply makes 
the distress more intense and tolerance more difficult. Frequentiy, the patient 
--- Page 170 ---
Behavioral Targets In Treatment 151 
could tolerate a distressing situation or painful affect if only she could refrain 
from feeling guilty or anxious about feeling bad in the first place. 
Taking Opposite Action. As discussed in Chapter 2, behavioral-
expressive responses are important parts of aU emotions. Thus, one strategy 
to change or regulate an emotion is to change its behavioral-expressive com­
ponent by acting in a way that opposes or is inconsistent with the emotion. 
The therapist should focus on the patient's overt actions (e.g., doing some­
thing nice for someone she is angry at, approaching what she is afraid of) 
as well as her postural and facial expressiveness. But, with respea to the lat­
ter, the therapist must make it clear that the idea is not to block expression 
of an emotion; rather, it is to express a different emotion. There is a very 
big difference between an constricted facial expression that blocks the ex­
pression of anger and a relaxed facial expression that expresses liking. This 
technique is discussed extensively in Chapter 11. 
Applying Distress Tolerance Techniques. Tolerating negative emotions 
without impulsive actions that make matters worse is, of course, one way to 
modulate the intensity and duration of negative emotions. Any or all of the 
distress tolerance techniques may be helpful here. 
Interpersonal Effectiveness Skills 
The particular behavioral patterns needed for social effectiveness depend 
almost entirely on one's goals in a particular situational context. The first 
seaion of the interpersonal skills module addresses this problem. As noted 
in connection with the apparent-competence syndrome in Chapter 3, bor­
derline individuals quite often have many conversational skUls in their reper­
toire. Social effectiveness, however, requires two complementary 
behavioral-expressive skills: (1) skills in producing automatic responses to sit­
uations encountered habitually; and (2) skills in producing novel responses 
or a combination of responses when the situation calls for them. 
The interpersonal response patterns taught in DBT are very simUar to 
those taught in assertiveness and interpersonal problem-solving classes. They 
include effective strategies for asking for what one needs, saying no, and coping 
with interpersonal conflia. "Effeaiveness" here means obtaining the changes 
one wants, keeping the relationship, and keeping one's self-respect. Although 
the skills included in this progoram are quite specific (see the skills training 
manual for further details), I suspect that any well-developed interpersonal 
training program could be substituted for the DBT package. 
Again, borderline and suicidal individuals frequently possess good in­
terpersonal skills in a general sense. The problems arise in the application 
of these skills to the situations that the patients encounter. They may be able 
to describe effective behavioral sequences when discussing another person 
encountering a problematic situation, but may be completely incapable of 
--- Page 171 ---
152 TREATMENT OVERVIEW AND GOALS 
generating or carrying out a simUar behavioral sequence when analyzing their 
own situation. UsuaUy, the problem is that both belief patterns and uncon­
trollable affective responses are inhibiting the application of social skills. 
A behavioral mistake that borderline individuals often make is prema­
ture termination of relationships. This probably results from difficulties in 
all of the target areas. Problems in affect tolerance make it difficult to toler­
ate the fears, anxieties, or frustrations that are typical in conflictual situa­
tions. Problems in affect regulation lead to inabUity to decrease chronic anger 
or frustration; inadequate self-regulation and interpersonal problem-solving 
skills make it difficult to turn potential relationship conflicts into positive en­
counters. Borderline individuals frequently vaciUate between avoidance of con­
flia and intense confrontation. Unfortunately, the choice of avoidance versus 
confrontation is based on the patients' affeaive state rather than on the needs 
of the current situation. In DBT in general, therapists challenge patients' nega­
tive expectancies regarding their environment, their relationships, and them­
selves. The therapists should assist the patients in learning to apply specific 
interpersonal problem-solving, social, and assertiveness skiUs to modify aver­
sive environments and develop effective relationships. 
Self-Management Skills 
Self-management skills are needed to learn, maintain, and generalize new be­
haviors and to inhibit or extinguish undesirable behaviors and behavioral 
changes. Self-management skills include behavioral categories such as self-
control and goal-directed behavior. In its widest sense, the term "self-
management" refers to any attempt to control, manage, or otherwise change 
one's own behavior, thoughts, or emotional responses to events. In this sense, 
the DBT skills of mindfulness, distress tolerance, affect regulation, and inter­
personal problem solving can be thought of as specific types of self-
management skUls. The term is used here, however, to refer to the generic 
set of behavior capabUities that an individual needs in order to acquire fur­
ther skUls. To the extent that the borderline individual is deficient in self-
management skiUs, her ability to acquire the other skills targeted in DBT is 
seriously compromised. The self-management skills that should be targeted 
are discussed below. 
Knowledge of Principles of Behavior Change and Maintenance. Border­
line individuals are often seriously lacking in knowledge of fundamental prin­
ciples of changing and maintaining behavior. A patient's belief that people 
change complex behavior pattems in a heroic show of wUlpower sets the stage 
for an accelerating cycle of faUure and self-condemnation. The faUure to master 
a goal becomes one more proof that trait explanations of failure (laziness, 
lack of motivation, no "guts") are really true. The therapist must undermine 
this notion of how people change. Frequently, analogies to the learning of 
common everyday skills (e.g., learning to write, ride a bicylce, etc.) serve to 
--- Page 172 ---
Behavioral Targets in Treatment 153 
Ulustrate that willpower does not in itself produce success; it merely allows 
a person to persist in the face of the failure that is typically part of learning 
new behaviors. 
Borderline individuals need to learn principles of reinforcement, punish­
ment, shaping, environment-behavior relationships, extinction, and so forth. 
Thus, principles of leaming and behavioral control in general, as well as 
knowledge about how these principles apply in each individual's case, are 
important targets in teaching self-management skills. Learning these targeted 
concepts often involves a substantial change in a patient's belief structure, 
especially of her beliefs about those factors controlling her own behavior. 
Realistic Goal Setting. Borderline patients also need to learn how to 
formulate positive goals in place of negative goals, to assess both positive and 
negative goals realistically, and to examine their life patterns from the point 
of view of values clarification. Borderline patients typically beHeve that nothing 
short of perfeaion is an acceptable outcome. Behavior change goals are often 
sweeping in context and clearly exceed the skills the patients may possess. 
Encouraging patients to "think small" and "accumulate small positives" can 
be helpful here. 
Environmental/Behavioral Analysis Skills. Therapists wiU need to teach 
patients such skills as self-monitoring and environmental monitoring, setting 
up and evaluating baselines, and evaluating empirical data to determine rela­
tionships between antecedent and consequent events and their own responses. 
These skUls are very similar to the hypothesis-testing skUls taught in cogni­
tive therapy (Beck et al., 1979). 
Contingency Management Skills. Borderline individuals frequently have 
great difficulty in formulating and carrying out contingency management 
plans. In my experience, most have enormous difficulty with the concept of 
self-reward. Usually, the problem is that their thought patterns center around 
deserving versus not deserving rewards or punishments. Since the entire no­
tion of deserving versus not deserving is based on judgments, work on con­
tingency management has to be interwoven with teaching mindfulness skills. 
A patient will often admit to believing that administering self-punishment 
or deprivation is the only effective way to change her inadequate behavior. 
The therapist should specifically point out the numerous negative effects of 
this strategy (e.g., "If you do overeat again, what additional problems are you 
creating by then starving yourself as punishment?") and attempt to generate 
nonaversive behavior management contingencies. In my experience, the ther­
apist has to be both knowledgeable about the rules of learning and persua­
sive about the problematic effects of misapplying contingencies. 
Environmental Control Techniques. A invalidating environment's belief 
that an individual can overcome any set of environmental stimuli is based 
--- Page 173 ---
154 TREATMENT OVERVIEW AND GOALS 
on the assumption that individuals can function independently of their en­
vironments. Given this set of beliefs, it is understandable that borderline pa­
tients are not particularly skUled at utilizing their environments as a means 
of controlling their own behavior. As I have discussed in Chapter 3, however, 
borderline individuals are likely to be more responsive to transitory environ­
mental cues than are others. Thus, the ability to manage their environmental 
surroundings effeaively can be particularly crucial, lechniques such as stimu­
lus narrowing (e.g., reducing the number of distraaing events in the immedi­
ately surrounding environment) and stimulus avoidance (avoiding events that 
precipitate problematic behaviors) should be targeted in particular, to coun­
teract a patient's tendencies to believe that "willpower" alone is sufficient. 
Relapse Prevention Plans. Like the alcoholic individuals described so well 
by Alan Marlatt (see Marlatt & Gordon, 1985), borderline individuals fre­
quently respond to any relapse or small faUure as an indication that they are 
total failures and may as well give up. For example, they will develop a self-
management plan and then unrealistically expect perfection in adhering to 
the plan. The target here is attitudinal change. It is important to teach the 
patients to plan realistically for relapse, as well as to develop strategies for 
accepting relapse nonevaluatively and for mitigating the negative effects of 
relapse. 
Ability to Tolerate Limited Progress. Because borderline individuals have 
little tolerance for feeling bad, they have difficulties carrying out behavior 
change action plans that require a "wait-and-see" approach. Rather, they will 
often engage in the "quick-fix syndrome," which involves setting unreasona­
bly short time limits for relatively complex changes. To put it another way, 
progress is expeaed to occur overnight, otherwise, the plan has failed. Once 
again, emphasizing the gradual nature of behavior change and the need to 
tolerate some negative affect in the interim should be a major focus of ther­
apists' efforts. 
What About Other Behavioral Skills Training Programs? 
You may be wondering whether you need to stick to DBT-specific behavioral 
skills training or whether you can use other skills training programs instead. 
Different programs may be available in your area or to your patients, or you 
may be more famiHar with another program. Mindfulness skUls can be leamed 
in meditation programs based on principles similar to mindfulness, or from 
a meditation teacher. There are dozens of self-help books and classes on per­
sonal self-management and on interpersonal skills and effectiveness, includ­
ing assertiveness classes. A number of specific programs are designed to help 
individuals with emotion regulation-most notably, struaured cognitive and 
cognitive-behavioral programs for depression, anxiety and/or panic, and anger 
control-and more such programs are being developed every day. Distress 
--- Page 174 ---
Behavioral Targets in Treatment 155 
tolerance is perhaps the one area of DBT skills training that is not covered 
in numerous other publications and programs. 
There is no a priori reason why one skills training program cannot be 
substituted for another. A number of considerations besides practicalities, 
however, must be taken into account. First, you must thoroughly know the 
skiUs each patient is leaming. Your task will be to help the patient learn them 
and apply them, often in situations of great stress. You cannot teach what 
you do not know. In my clinical program, therapists often leam the DBT skiUs 
by studying the DBT skills training manual that accompanied this book and 
trying out the homework assignment themselves. It is something of a "learn 
as you go" program, often with both therapists and patients learning the skUls 
together (at least at first). Although the skUls I discuss in DBT are organized 
in a somewhat idiosyncratic manner and are described in terminology you 
may not use, they are actually reasonably basic skills that most people have 
at least some familiarity with. 
Second, if you send your patient somewhere else for skills training, it 
is important that you use the same skills terminology as that used in skills 
training; otherwise, the patient may feel confused and overwhelmed. You need 
to have access to the training materials used by the skills trainer. Third, you 
need to be sure that the skills you teach are relevant to BPD and to the specif­
ic problems of each patient. Fourth, it is important to interrelate the skills 
taught in each module and to develop a method of tracking the use of skills 
over time, especially when you are not aaively teaching a specific set of skills 
at the moment. In a sense, what I am recommending is that if you do not 
use the DBT skills training manual as is, you consider either writing one of 
your own or modifying the manual to suit your own purposes. 
Decreasing Behaviors Related to Posttraumatic Stress 
When a borderline patient has serious, unresolved, and untreated traumatic 
life events, reduction of related stress response pattems is a primary DBT tar­
get. As Chapter 2 has indicated, a majority of patients in DBT can be expect­
ed to report at least one instance of sexual abuse in childhood. A number 
of these patients, as weU as others with no history of sexual abuse, wUl report 
physical and emotional trauma and neglea during childhood, which in some 
cases may have been especially violent, intrusive, pervasive, and/or chronic. 
The therapist must be very careful, however, not to assume that all border­
line patients have histories of severe sexual or physical abuse, or even of trau­
matic neglect; some do not. This does not mean, however, that they may not 
have experienced trauma. Some have experienced loss of important persons 
through death, divorce, or relocation; others have suffered traumatic threats 
of loss; StiU others have experienced parental alcoholic rages, unexpected or 
persistent traumatic rejeaions, or chaotic life circumstances. At a minimum, 
if the biosocial theory proposed in Chapter 2 is correct, all borderiine pa­
tients will have experienced pervasive invalidating environments. 
--- Page 175 ---
156 TREATMENT OVERVIEW AND GOALS 
The work done in this target area is similar to that done in "uncovering" 
work or to the focus on childhood precursors to dysfunctional behaviors in 
psychodynamic therapies. The difference is that no a priori assumptions are 
made about which particular event(s) or what developmental phase of an in­
dividual's life is functionally related to current traumatic stress. 
Information about the facts of previous sexual, physical, or emotional 
trauma and/or physical or emotional neglect should be obtained on a con­
tinuing and as-needed basis as therapy progresses. Some patients will give this 
information readily; others will only disclose information about abuse gradu­
ally or after some time in therapy. The therapist should read all records of 
previous treatment for clues about abuse history. At times, however, the facts 
of all or some abuse history may not have been disclosed during previous 
therapies. Because of the trauma associated with even therapeutic exposure 
to abuse-related cues, eliciting of details and events associated with early 
trauma generally does not take place until suicidal, therapy-interfering, and 
serious quality-of-life interfering behaviors have been substantially reduced 
and behavioral skills are in place. This issue is discussed in more depth in 
the next chapter. 
Characteristic sequelae of childhood sexual abuse have been described 
by Briere (1989) and are listed in Table 5.4. A number of these sequelae are 
the behavioral problems targeted directly in DBT, while others overlap with 
charaaeristics of posttraumatic stress disorder. As noted earlier, some authors 
have suggested that BPD itself should be reconceptualized as posttraumatic 
stress associated with childhood abuse. Although DBT does not take this po­
sition, certainly many of the behavioral problems of borderline patients may 
be directly related to previous abusive experiences. 
Accepting the Fact of Trauma and/or Abuse 
Coming to terms with and accepting the facts of the trauma that took place 
is both the first and the last target in treating the sequelae of traumatic ex­
periences. Individuals who have been severely traumatized often have little 
memory of the experience. The first target, therefore, is for the patient to 
verbalize the traumatic incidents sufficiently to begin work. When one or more 
events (or fragments of events) are remembered, the next task is for the in­
dividual to believe that the events she remembered (or some approximation 
of the events) aaually took place. This can be a very difficult part of therapy, 
since trauma victims often fear that they have simply imagined or made up 
the traumatic events or abuse. 
It is also difficult because retrospectively one never has direct access to 
events that took place in the past. Thus, an important task for the patient 
(and sometimes for the therapist also) is to learn to trust herself even when 
the aaual faas of her life may be uncertain. The goal for many patients is 
to synthesize both knowing that something happened, on the one hand, and 
not knowing exactiy what happened, on the other. Comfort with ambiguity

and uncertainty, discussed at the beginning of the chapter, becomes part of 
the goal. As the story unfolds, the task of grieving and radically accepting 
the reality of one's life becomes at once both crucial and extremely difficult 
for many to negotiate. It is within this context that radical acceptance, taught 
as a core mindfulness skUl, must be leamed and practiced. The inability to 
grieve, discussed in Chapter 3, is one of the main impediments to successful 
passage through this phase. Judith Herman (1992) has called this the remem­
brance and mourning phase of treating traumatic people and describes most 
eloquenriy both the immense difficulty and the courage needed. 
Reducing Stigmatization, Self-Invalidation, Self-Blame 
The second goal is to reduce the stigmatization, self-invalidation, and self-
blame associated with trauma. Victims of abuse typically believe that they 
are somehow reprehensively different from others; otherwise, the abuse would 
not have occurred. They often believe that they caused the abuse, or that 
because they did not stop it (and at times might have found it pleasurable.

in the case of sexual abuse), they are "bad" or "sick" or both. Even when 
they do not feel responsible for the occurrence of traumatic events, victims 
often beHeve that they are responsible for, and feel ashamed of, their reac­
tions to the trauma. At times they minimize the severity of the trauma. 
Reducing Denial and Intrusive Stress Responses 
When an individual is confronted with severe trauma, responses occur in two 
phases, which often repeat thems^'ves in a cyclical fashion: a "denial" phase 
and an "intrusive" phase. Responses occurring in these two phases have been 
outlined by Horowitz (1986) and are listed in Table 5.5. Even when the facts 
of the trauma have been accepted, the individual may continue to disavow 
the implications of the traumatic event and to exhibit the other denial-phase 
responses listed in the table. In individual or group sessions, when cues as­
sociated with the trauma are brought up, the individual may become mute 
and stare blankly into space. The denial phase is quite simUar to the border­
line syndrome I have described as "inhibited grieving" (see Chapter 3). 
The intrusive phase is similar to what I have described in Chapter 3 as 
the emotional viUnerability syndrome. During the intrusive phase, a wide range 
of stimuli originally unrelated to the trauma may become associated with trau­
ma cues and responses. Over time, if this phase lasts long enough, these 
responses and associations tend to extinguish. However, when the denial phase 
follows quickly, the extinaion does not occur, and a cycle in which one phase 
rapidly follows the other can continue over many years. Such is the case with 
the borderline patient. 
Synthesizing the "Abuse Dichotomy" 
The "abuse dichotomy" is a phrase coined by Briere (1989) to refer to the 
tendency of victims of childhood abuse to conceptualize responsibility for 
their abuse in black-and-white terms: Either their abusers are all bad for abus­
ing them, or they are all bad because they were abused. Often their views 
of who is all bad vacUlate from moment to moment. This is a case of nondi­
alectical thinking, or "splitting" in psychoanalytic terms. Resolution of this 
dialectical tension is the target here. The therapist must be careful, however, 
not to imply that the only synthesis possible for a patient is forgiveness of 
the abuser. Although acceptance of the facts of abuse is essential, and some 
understanding of the abusive behavior as a consequence of events surround­
ing the abuser may be important, forgiveness itself may not always be possi­
ble. In addition, the therapist must be equally careful not to paint the abuser 
in entirely negative terms, especially when the abuser was a caregiver or par­
ent. For most individuals, it is important to salvage at least some positive 
relationship with parental figures. Pushing a patient to stop loving a parent 
denies the valuable parts of the relationship, and thus results in a loss to the 
patient. Many victims of abuse cannot tolerate that further loss. Instead, the 
--- Page 179 ---
160 TREATMENT OVERVIEW AND GOALS 
goal must be to achieve a synthesis in which a patient does not have to lose 
her own integrity to retain a relationship with the abuser. 
Increasing Respect for Self 
"Respect for self encompasses the abUity to value, believe, validate, trust, 
and cherish oneself, including one's own thoughts, emotions, and behavior 
patterns. The idea here is not that anyone's emotional, cognitive, and be­
havioral responses are entirely adaptive or beneficial. Indeed, the ability to 
evaluate one's own behavior nondefensively is an important charaaeristic of 
adaptive functioning and an outcome of enhanced self-respect, and the abili­
ty to trust one's own self-evaluations is crucial to growth. The borderline pa­
tient, however, is usually unable to evaluate her own responses and hold on 
to her self-evaluations independently of the opinions of important others, in­
cluding the therapist. She is unable to respect her own self-evaluative capa­
bilities. Thus, she is buffeted by changes in opinions and the presence or ab­
sence of important others—opinions and events that are usually out of her 
control. Much of this difficulty is a result of excessive fear of social disap­
proval. Borderline individuals often operate as if their well-being is totally 
dependent on the approval of all persons important to them. One goal of 
the therapist, therefore, is to increase appropriate self-evaluation and toler­
ance of social disapproval, and to extinguish behaviors contradiaory to these 
goals. 
Many borderline patients reaa to themselves with extreme loathing, bor­
dering on self-hate. All but a few feel enormous shame in general, and shame 
about their own abuse history, the troubles they have caused, and their present 
emotional reactivity in particular. Cherishing oneself is the opposite of these 
emotional reactions. Thus, the therapist must target the self-hate, the self-
blame, and the sense of shame. Although work on this target is a lifelong 
process, substantial progress should be made before therapy ends. 
One thing the therapist must be especially careful to do before therapy 
ends is to reinforce patient self-respect that is independent of the therapist. 
That is, the therapist must ultimately pull back and relentlessly reinforce with­
in the therapeutic relationship self-validation, self-care, self-soothing, and 
problem solving without reference to the therapist. I hasten to add, however, 
that this stance does not suggest that patients should learn to be independent 
of all people. Interpersonal dependence, asking for and accepting nurturing, 
soothing, and active assistance from others are crucial for most people's well-
being. Indeed, the ability to be related to and to depend on others without 
invalidating one self is an important target of DBT. 
Secondary Behavioral Targets 
A number of response patterns may be functionally related to the primary 
target problems of borderiine patients. These pattems are secondary DBT tar-
--- Page 180 ---
Behavioral Targets in Treatment 161 
gets. The importance of any secondary target for the individual patient in 
DBT, however, is entirely dependent on its relationship to achieving the primary 
target goals. In the individual case, it is crucial that the presence of each secon­
dary pattern and the functional relationship of the pattern to primary targets 
be assessed, rather than assumed. If changing a particular secondary pattern 
is not instrumental in achieving primary goals, the response pattern is not 
targeted. Thus, the secondary target list is a set of hypotheses to be tested. 
The secondary target list proposed in DBT is based on the poles of the 
dialectical dilemmas I have described in Chapter 3. The targets are as fol­
lows: (1) increasing emotion modulation and decreasing emotional reactivi­
ty; (2) increasing self-validation and reducing self-invalidation; (3) increasing 
realistic decision making and judgment, and reducing crisis-generating be­
haviors; (4) increasing emotional experiencing and decreasing inhibited griev­
ing; (5) increasing active problem solving and decreasing active-passivity be­
haviors; and (6) increasing accurate expression of emotions and competen­
cies and decreasing mood dependency of behavior. 
Increasing Emotion Modulation; 
Decreasing Emotional Reactivity 
The first secondary target is to increase the emotion modulation and reduce 
the lightning-quick emotional reactivity of the borderline individual. The 
specific behavioral skills that are most helpful in this regard are mindfulness 
(especiaUy nonjudgmental observation of events precipitating emotional 
responses), the distress tolerance attitudes of acceptance and willingness, and 
emotion regulation practices included under the rubric of reducing vulnera­
bility. 
Increasing modulation and reducing reactivity should be clearly distin­
guished from emotional nonreactivity. The idea is not to get rid of emotions; 
indeed, DBT assumes that former borderline individuals will continue to be 
the emotionally intense, colorful, and dramatic people of the world. Nor is 
the focus on the irrationality of a patient's responses. Rather, the focus is on 
the extremity of the responses. The idea is to reduce intolerable rage to toler­
able anger, incapacitating panic to prudent fear, immobilizing grief to reflec­
tive sadness, and humUiating shame to transitory guilt. In other words, the 
assumption is not that extreme emotions are based on irrational beliefs about 
a rational world; rather, they are seen as overshooting the mark. 
Increasing Self-Validation; Decreasing Self-Invalidation 
Self-acceptance and self-soothing are specific skills included in the distress 
tolerance skill package. Since patients pick and choose their distress toler­
ance strategies, it is common for patients to ignore these two. However, self-
invalidation and self-hate are often related to suicidal behaviors, failures in 
self-management programs, and increases in emotional vulnerability. When 
--- Page 181 ---
162 TREATMENT OVERVIEW AND GOALS 
such is the case, these behaviors should be targeted direaly by the individual 
therapist. Increasing self-vaHdation and reducing self-hate are important com­
ponents of self-respect, and thus become primary targets in the later stages 
of therapy. 
Increasing Realistic Decision Making and Judgment; 
Decreasing Crisis-Generating Behaviors 
DBT does not assume that borderline individuals precipitate all of their own 
crises. But it also does not assume the opposite —that patients have nothing 
to do with generating crises. The two patient charaaeristics most related to 
crises are mood dependency and the resulting mood-related behavioral choices 
(to be discussed below), and difficulty in predicting realistic outcomes for 
various behavioral choices —that is, poor judgment. To a certain extent mood 
dependency further exacerbates poor judgment, since an individual often can­
not predict how her reactions will change from one mood to another, and 
thus cannot predia her own behavior. The invalidating environment teaches 
the individual to look to others for behavioral solutions, instead of shaping 
individual problem-solving and decision-making skills. In a chaotic family, 
there is little modeling and teaching of realistic decision making. A patient 
from such a family needs to learn to predict realistic outcomes (both short-
term and long-term) of behavioral choices. Many of the self-management skiUs 
needed in DBT are related to issues of making realistic judgments about 
oneself. 
Increasing Emotional Experiencing; 
Decreasing Inhibited Grieving 
The ability to experience emotions as they occur, especially negatiave emo­
tions, is crucial to their reduction. The rationale for this has been discussed 
extensively in Chapter 3 and is not repeated here. Thus, an important target 
of treatment for many patients is increasing their ability to experience rather 
than inhibit negative emotions. In extreme cases, where patients are almost 
totally incapable of experiencing negative affect for more than a moment, 
this target may take on the status of a primary target. 
Increasing Active Problem Solving; 
Decreasing Active-Passivity Behaviors 
Borderiine patients have a tendency to react to problems passively-a tendency 
that not only interferes with achieving some life goals, but also can be ex­
tremely frustrating for the therapist. As discussed in Chapter 3, borderiine 
"aaive passivity" is perhaps the result of a biologically mediated passive self-
regulation style combined with learned helplessness. An important target of 
DBT is to disrupt this interaction style and increase the use of active problem 
--- Page 182 ---
Behavioral Targets in Treatment 163 
solving. AU of the DBT behavioral skills both rely on and feed back into ac­
tive problem-solving behaviors. 
Attempting to increase borderline patients' ability and motivation to 
generate problem solutions, try them out, and evaluate their effectiveness is 
the point at which therapy can become derailed. The problem is quite simi­
lar, of course, to problems that arise for the patients outside of therapy. A 
mistake that many therapists make is trying to make apples into oranges. That 
is, therapists often try to make patients who prefer a passive self-regulation 
style into people who prefer an active self-regulation style. I suspect that this 
approach is doomed to failure a good percentage of the time. The focus in 
DBT is on helping patients become good passive self-regulators. The notion 
here is that an individual who prefers a passive self-regulation style (i.e., al­
lowing persons or events in the environment to regulate her behavior) can 
learn to control her own behavior by skillfully controlling the structure of 
the environment. Signing contraas, setting up deadlines, making Hsts and writ­
ten schedules, and arranging to be around people are all examples of passive 
self-regulation. 
Increasing Accurate Communication of Emotions and 
Competencies; Decreasing Mood Dependency of Behavior 
Borderline individuals often miscommunicate their current emotional state, 
as noted in Chapter 3. Although at times they communicate exaggerated emo­
tional responses, at other times they inhibit expressions of negative emotions. 
Such a pattern is predictable for anyone brought up in an invalidating en­
vironment. Borderline individuals, however, are often unaware that they are 
not expressing emotions accurately; instead, they frequently believe that other 
persons are aware of how they feel but are "withholding" in their responses 
to the patients' distress. Thus, it is crucial that the individuals learn how to 
express emotions accurately (both nonverbally and verbally), as well as to 
assess whether their emotional expression has been understood. 
Similarly, borderline individuals also have problems with communicat­
ing to others when they are having difficulty or are not competent to handle 
a particular situation. Part of the problem here is that patients often are not 
good judges of their own competencies; frequently, they believe they are una­
ble to cope with a situation when they are simply afraid. At other times, 
however, patients communicate competency when in fact they are not able 
to cope. The net result is that people tend to see them as the boy who cried 
"wolf' too many times, and falsely believe that the patients are comfortable 
in a situation when they themselves feel that they are "falling apart." All peo­
ple, including borderline patients, must be able to communicate needs for 
assistance or help in such a way that others will heed the message. Much 
of interpersonal effectiveness skills training addresses just this topic. 
The rule that action must be in accord with mood is a dysfunctional 
opposite extreme that is also typical of borderiine individuals. Separating cur-
--- Page 183 ---
164 TREATMENT OVERVIEW AND GOALS 
rent mood from current behavior is essential if primary target goals are to 
be reached in DBT. The emphasis in DBT on distress tolerance and accep­
tance of life as it is, without necessarily changing it, is based on precisely 
this point. Although I am discussing mood dependency of behavior last, it 
is by no means least important. In many ways, all of DBT focuses on this 
target, since the link between negative mood and congruent maladaptive be­
havior is extinguished (and sometimes punished) consistently throughout 
therapy. 
Concluding Comments 
DBT target priorities are a defining characteristic of the therapy. Knowing 
or being able to Hst the targets in order of priority, however, is only the first 
step. The crucial second skill, which can only be learned by practice, is the 
ability to monitor the great influx of a patient's behavior as it rushes by and 
to organize it into the relevant categories. Once you can pigeonhole what the 
patient is doing on a continuing basis, then you can survey the array of be­
haviors, look at your priorities, and decide what to focus on at the moment. 
It is a bit like learning to read a complex piece of music. First, you must be 
able to identify the notes. Once you can read the notes, you have to be able 
to play the music. That is the topic of the next chapter

Structuring Treatment 
Around Target Behaviors: 
Who Treats What and When 
T he unrelenting crises and behavioral 
complexity of a borderline patient often overwhelm both the patient and the 
therapist. At times, so many environmental problems and maladaptive be­
haviors are occurring simultaneously that the therapist has difficulty decid­
ing how to focus therapy time. The fact that the patient often makes intense 
efforts to focus sessions on her current life crises does not help in this situa­
tion. Mood dependency can make it difficult for a borderline individual to 
address any problem not related to her current emotional experience; the in­
tensity of her communications of emotional pain can make it equally difficult 
for the therapist to focus on anything else. DBT targets priorities, which are 
guidelines for how to structure therapy time, are designed to help out here. 
When a therapist is feeling overwhelmed by the clinical situation, DBT target 
priorities indicate what to focus on. 
The spirit of DBT is that treatment targets, as well as the priorities ac­
corded to them, must be clear and specific. Targets as well as priorities are 
different in each mode (e.g., individual therapy, group therapy, telephone con­
sultation) of DBT. Thus, it is essential that each individual providing treat­
ment for the borderline patient be clear and specific about which targets that 
individual is responsible for. Even if a therapist is the only therapist for a 
particular patient, it is important to have a clear idea of priorities in each 
interaction; priorities in a psychotherapy session, for example, may be very 
different from priorities during a phone conversation. 
In this chapter, I describe how treatment targets are organized in stan­
dard DBT. The most important point is that although specific priorities can 
change (and probably must change in some settings), the requirement for clar­
ity and specificity should not be dropped. If the target order, the division of 
165 
--- Page 185 ---
166 TREATMENT OVERVIEW AND GOALS 
target priorities across treatment modes, or the responsibility for achieving 
target goals is changed, the therapist must be clear and specific about what 
is being changed and how. 
The General Theme: Targeting Dialectical Behaviors 
The goal of increasing dialeaical behavior pattems among borderline patients 
is the theme that guides DBT's approach to all other target behaviors. This 
target differs from the others in three ways. First, it is a target of all modes 
of treatment. The attention accorded to other behavioral targets varies by treat­
ment mode; in contrast, all modes of DBT attend to dialeaical behavior pat­
terns. All therapists try both to model and to reinforce a dialeaical style of 
thinking and approaching problems and to challenge nondialeaical thinking 
or approaches to problems, as Chapter 5 has described. 
Second, in contrast to other therapy targets, inaeasing dialeaical behavior 
patterns as a specific therapy target is rarely discussed with the patient. That 
is, the patient does not make an explicit commitment to work at becoming 
more dialeaical. The main reason for this is that I have believed that the con­
cept of dialeaics is overly abstract, and feared that explanation and instruc­
tion might get in the way instead of facilitating learning. In addition, I have 
thought that the very absence of dialectical thinking patterns would prevent 
commitment to work toward adopting such a style of thought. For example, 
the individual who believes that there is a universal order to reality, and thus 
that absolute truth is knowable, is not likely to agree to let go of this ap­
proach to knowing and ordering the universe. My reluctance to teach dialec­
tical patterns explicitly, however, may be an overly timid approach. Several 
cognitive therapists (e.g., Bech et al., 1990) focus treatment direaly on chang­
ing cognitive style, with good results. At a minimum, one might emphasize 
balanced thinking and action (as opposed to dichotomous thinking and ex­
treme action) in teaching the sets of skills discussed in Chapter 5. 
A third difference between targeting dialectical behavior pattems and tar­
geting other behaviors is that, because it forms an aspect of each of the other 
goals to be achieved, dialectical behavior is not on the hierarchical list of tar­
gets to be discussed next. 
The Hierarchy of Primary Targets 
The remaining seven primary behavioral targets outiined in Chapter 5 can 
be assigned to a hierarchy in order of importance. The hierarchy for the treat­
ment as a whole is shown in Table 6.1; it reflects the order in which these 
targets have been discussed in Chapter 5. This is also the order of priority 
for targets in outpatient individual therapy. The hierarchies for other modes 
of therapy differ slightly, as I discuss later in this chapter. Although the list

Treatment Targets and Session Agenda 
Although the importance of each target does not change over therapy, the 
relevance of a target does change. Relevance is determined by the patient's 
current day-to-day behavior, as well by as her behavior during the therapy 
interaction. Problems not evident in the patient's current behavior are not 
currently relevant. Relevance and importance determine what the therapist 
should pay the most attention to when interaaing with the patient. The basic 
idea here is that the therapist applies the DBT strategies and techniques (dis­
cussed in Chapters 7-15) to the highest-priority treatment target relevant at 
the moment. If a particular target goal has already been reached, or if problems 
in the target area have never arisen for the patient, are not evident in the pa­
tient's current behavior, or have already been addressed in the current ses­
sion, then targets next on the list become the principal focus of the treatment. 
Treatment Targets and Modes of Therapy 
Responsibility for achieving specific target goals is spread across the various 
modes of DBT (individual psychotherapy behavioral skills training, suppor­
tive process groups, phone calls). The priority assigned to each treatment tar­
get, the amount of attention each target receives, and the nature of that 
attention vary, depending on the mode of therapy. Thus, as noted above, each 
mode of therapy has its own unique hierarchical ordering of treatment goals. 
--- Page 187 ---
168 TREATMENT OVERVIEW AND GOALS 
The individual therapist pays attention to one order of targets, the skiUs train­
ing therapists another, and the process group therapists another; in telephone 
interaaions, yet another order of targets guides the conversation. In some set­
tings, the milieu and unit or clinic director may be part of the DBT team. If 
so, then the milieu and unit director have their own lists of target priorities as 
well. If other modes are added to the treatment, prioritized target Hsts must be 
drawn up for each mode. In principle, the division of responsibUity for targets 
can be divided up in any number of ways to reflect various treatment settings 
and modes of therapy. These possibilities are discussed more fully later in 
this chapter. 
The key point to be made here is that all DBT therapists in a particular 
setting must understand clearly what their own hierarchies of targets are with 
each patient and how those hierarchies fit into the overall hierarchy of DBT 
behavioral targets. Generally, the targets and their order are tied to each specific 
mode of treatment. Thus, if therapists are carrying out more than one mode 
of treatment (e.g., if the individual therapist is also the process group ther­
apist, or if the individual therapist or skills trainer also takes phone calls), 
then they must be able to remember the order of targets specific to each mode, 
and must be able to switch smoothly from one hierarchy to another as they 
switch from one mode to another. 
The Primary Therapist and Responsibility for Meeting Targets 
In each treatment unit, one therapist is designated the primary therapist for 
a particular patient. In our outpatient unit, as in individual clinical practice, 
the therapist is the patient's individual psychotherapist. The primary ther­
apist is responsible for treatment planning, working with the patient on 
progress toward all targets, and helping the patient integrate (or occasionally 
decide to discard) what is being learned in other modes of therapy. In my 
experience, if the primary therapist does not help the patient to integrate and 
strengthen what is being learned elsewhere, such learning is often seriously 
weakened. All therapists in a common setting may take part in treatment plan­
ning, have input into which specific behaviors should receive attention in each 
category of targets, and together decide a division of target responsibilities 
among treatment modes and therapists. However, the primary therapist has 
the task of helping the patient remember and take into account the "big pic­
ture," so to speak. As I emphasize in discussing the consultation-to-the-patient 
strategies in Chapter 13, the primary therapist consults with the patient on 
how to interact effectively with all other members of the treatment unit and 
professional community. (Conversely, other therapists consult with the pa­
tient on how to interact with her primary therapist.) 
Progress Toward Targets Over Time 
In my experience, progress toward treatment targets can be grouped into 
phases. Although the stages of therapy are presented here in chronological 
--- Page 188 ---
Structuring Treatment around Target Behaviors 169 
order for heuristic purposes, therapy usually develops in a circular fashion. 
Thus, although orienting the patient to therapy and focusing on therapy ex­
pectations ordinarily occur during the first several sessions, these issues are 
likely to be important throughout therapy. The first stage of therapy includes 
behavioral analysis and treatment of suicidal behaviors, therapy-interfering 
behaviors, behavioral patterns that seriously interfere with the quality of life, 
and skUl deficiencies. For some patients, however, problems in these areas 
may be continuing concerns throughout therapy. The second stage of treat­
ment, oriented to reducing posttraumatic stess, at times requires attention right 
from the beginning of therapy; moreover, such stress is unlikely to be fully 
remediated even by the end of therapy. The final stage targets goals of self-
respect, generalization, integration, and termination. These issues, however, 
are dealt with from the very beginning of treatment and arise sporadically 
throughout the entire treatment. 
Pretreatment Stage: Orientation and Commitment 
A continuing concern in conducting treatment with borderline and parasui­
cidal patients is the possibility that a significant percentage will terminate ther­
apy prematurely. The use of pretreatment orientation sessions has been em­
pirically linked to a reduced dropout rate in several treatment studies (Parloff, 
Waskow, & Wolfe, 1978). Thus, the first several sessions of individual thera­
py focus on preparations for therapy. The goals of this stage are twofold. First, 
the patient and therapist must arrive at a mutual, informed decision to work 
together on helping the patient make changes she wants to make in herself 
and in her life. Second, the therapist attempts to modify any dysfunaional be­
liefs or expeaations of the patient regarding therapy that are likely to influence 
the process of therapy and/or the decision to terminate therapy prematurely. 
With respea to the first goal, the patient must find out as much as pos­
sible about the therapist's interpersonal style, professional competence, treat­
ment goals, and intentions regarding the conduct of therapy. The therapist 
has to assist the patient in making an informed decision about committing 
to therapy, and must also obtain sufficient information about the patient to 
decide whether he or she can work with the patient. Diagnostic and assess­
ment interviewing, plus history taking, should occur at this point. With respea 
to the patient's therapy-oriented beliefs and expectations, the therapist 
describes the treatment program and the rate and magnitude of change that 
can be expected to occur within it; determines and discusses the patient's be­
liefs about psychotherapists and psychotherapy in general; and attempts to 
"reframe" psychotherapy as a learning process. Details on how to conduct 
these orientation sessions are provided in Chapters 9 and 14. 
Stage I: Attaining Basic Capacities 
As noted above, the first phase of therapy centers on suicidal behaviors, 
therapy-interfering behaviors, major quality-of-life-interfering behaviors, and 
--- Page 189 ---
170 TREATMENT OVERVIEW AND GOALS 
deficits in behavioral skUls. With severely dysfunaional, highly suicidal pa­
tients, it may take a year of more to get control of the first two targets. Progress 
on quality-of-life-interfering behaviors depend to some extent on what the 
aaual interfering behaviors are. For addiaive behaviors, simply getting a com­
mitment from the patient to work on these behaviors can take a long time. 
I once had a patient with a serious drinking problem who took over 2 years 
to commit to work on reducing her excessive alcohol consumption; even then 
it took a conviaion for driving while intoxicated, a court-ordered 2-year treat­
ment program, and my putting her on a "vacation" from therapy to persuade 
her to make the commitment. (The strategy of "vacation from therapy" is dis­
cussed in Chapter 10.) 
Generally, by the end of the first year of therapy, patients should also 
have at least a working knowledge of and competence in the major behavioral 
skills taught in DBT. Although application of these skills to various target 
problem areas is a continuing focus of therapy, the large amount of time de­
voted to acquisition of skills during the first stage is usually not required in 
subsequent phases of therapy, except in cases when the primary therapist does 
not sufficiently help the patient integrate the skills she is learning. Again, my 
experience is that if the primary therapist does not value the skills and help 
the patient integrate them into her daUy life, the patient will often forget what 
she has learned. 
Stage 2: Reducing Posttraumatic Stress 
The second phase of therapy, begun only when previous target behaviors are 
under control, involves working directly on posttraumatic stress. The status 
of posttraumatic stress as a second-stage target may be questioned by some. 
Those who believe that BPD is a special case of posttraumatic stress disorder 
may suggest that resolving early trauma, especially sexual abuse, should be 
the first priority of treatment; once that is resolved, all other problems wiU 
become manageable. Although I have some sympathy for this point of view, 
I believe that the resulting havoc in the patient's life and the suicide risk are 
such that the treatment of posttraumatic stress has to be very carefully timed. 
My experience with patients whose therapists began therapy with an "un­
covering" approach, where the initial focus of therapy sessions was on dis­
cussing childhood trauma (including sexual, physical, and/or emotional 
trauma or neglect), was that many of these patients simply could not handle 
the re-exposure to the traumatic events. Instead, they often became extreme­
ly suicidal, engaged in near-lethal parasuicidal acts or compulsively mutUat-
ed themselves, and/or had to be admitted and readmitted to inpatient 
psychiatric units. Thus, DBT does not focus on traumatic stress until a pa­
tient has the necessary capabilities and supports (both within therapy and 
in her environment outside therapy) to resolve the trauma successfully Satis­
factory progress through the first-stage targets readies the patient for subse­
quent work on previous tramatic experiences. In psychodynamic terms, the 
--- Page 190 ---
Structuring Treatment around Target Behaviors 171 
patient must have the necessary ego strength to do the therapy. 
This does not mean, of course, that previous trauma is ignored during 
the first stage of therapy if the patient brings it up. How it is responded to, 
however, depends on its relationship to other target behaviors. If the aftereffea 
of trauma (memories, flashbacks, self-blame, emotional responses to trauma-
associated cues, etc.) are funaionally related to subsequent suicidal behaviors, 
for example, then they are attended to just as any other precipitant of suici­
dal behavior would be. That is, their association to subsequent suicidal be­
havior becomes the focus of treatment. In any case, painful sequelae of trama 
are treated as problems to be solved (i.e., quality-of-life-interfering behaviors) 
when they arise in therapy. As part of treatment, the therapist ordinarily would 
also target the development of distress tolerance skUls and mindfulness skills 
(see Chapter 5), both of which are required in dealing with posttraumatic 
stress. The therapist takes a very here-and-now approach to managing dys­
functional behavioral and emotional patterns. Although the connection be­
tween current behavior and previous traumatic events, including those from 
chUdhood, may be explored and noted, the focus of the treatment is distinct­
ly on analyzing the relationship among current thoughts, feelings, and be­
haviors and on accepting and changing current patterns. What the therapist 
does not do during the first stage of therapy is refocus the major activities 
of therapy on addressing the prior trauma. Again, the rule here is that such 
trauma is not brought into therapy before the patient can cope with the con­
sequences of exposure to it. 
Because of its middle position in the three stages, the reduction of post­
traumatic stress reactions is often started, stopped, and restarted. For many 
patients, such a resolution wiU be a lifelong task with many beginnings and 
leavings. Some patients may enter therapy ready for Stage 2 of therapy: They 
are not aaively engaged in suicidal behaviors, are able to work in therapy, 
and have adequate stabUity and resources. Conversely, some patients who ap­
pear ready to work on Stage 2 goals may not be ready. Their apparent com­
petence may fool both therapist and patient. At times, a therapist will not 
even suspect that a patient meets criteria for BPD untU attempts to resolve 
earlier traumas precipitate extreme reactions typical of Stage 1. This is espe­
cially likely when the therapist has not conducted a comprehensive clinical 
assessment at the beginning of therapy. As I have mentioned previously, bor­
derline individuals sometimes funaion quite well when in supportive and nur­
turing relationships with little or no interpersonal stress. Although a patient 
may often be "crying on the inside," the therapist may not see the patient's 
distress until she is exposed once again to the trauma-associated cues. 
Stage 2 of DBT, however, requires exposure to the trauma-related cues. 
(See Chapter 11 for a thorough discussion of exposure techniques.) There is 
simply no other way to work on the stress responses to such cues. For some 
patients, the rate of exposure may need to be extremely gradual; for others. 
Stage 2 may go quite rapidly. The length of time and the pacing of therapy 
in Stage 2 will depend on the severity of the previous trauma and the pa-

tient's behavioral and social resources to cope with the therapy process. At 
times, therapist and patient may find it useful to take a break from therapy 
for a while. For example, one of my patients took several years to get through 
Stage 1 of therapy. When she was finally ready to focus on the severe sexual 
abuse she had received from ages 9 to 13 years, I was planning an 8-week 
trip out of the country for 8 months later. The patient's fear that she would 
be in the middle of a crisis period when I left was so great that it inhibited 
her ability to work hard on Stage 2 goals. We agreed to have monthly check-
in meetings until I left and to wait until I returned from my trip to begin Stage 
2 therapy. The patient stayed in her ongoing supportive process group thera­
py. Another patient left therapy after completing most of Stage 1. During the 
vacation time, she entered and completed a 1-year substance abuse program. 
She then returned to therapy with me to work on resolving traumatic rela­
tionships within her family of origin. 
It is extremely important that the therapist not mistake adequate coping 
with posttraumatic stress responses (a successful completion of Stage 1 of 
therapy) for a satisfaaory conclusion of therapy. Although the stability is now 
there for constructing a life worth living, the posttraumatic stress patterns 
themselves (see Chapter 5 for a detailed review) are nonetheless a source of 
considerable emotional pain and suffering. Although some individuals may 
be able to tolerate for long periods of life with much pain and suffering, others 
will finally go back to Stage 1 behaviors as a way to ameliorate the pain or 
to get further help. Thus, the gains of Stage 1 of therapy may be lost if Stage 
2 is not negotiated successfully. 
Stage 3: Increasing Self-Respect and 
Achieving Individual Goals 
Overlapping with the first two phases, and forming the final phase of thera­
py, is work on developing the ability to trust the self; to validate one's own 
opinions, emotions, and actions; and, in general, to respect oneself indepen­
dently of the therapist. Work on the patient's individual goals also occurs 
largely during this stage. It is of utmost importance that the skills the patient 
learns in therapy be generalized to nontherapeutic situations. The ordinary 
course of events in therapy with a borderline patient is that the patient will 
initially have great difficulty in trusting the therapist, in asking the therapist 
for help, and in arriving at an optimum balance between independence and 
dependence. Quite often during the first months of therapy, the patient will 
have trouble trusting the therapist, will not call the therapist even when it 
would be appropriate to do so, and wiU vacUlate between extreme dependence 
on the therapist to solve her problems and an independent attitude of "I don't 
need anything or anybody." Exploration of these patterns wUl often indicate 
that the same interpersonal patterns are also occurring with others in the pa­
tient's environment. Thus the ability to ttust, to ask for help appropriately, 
and both to depend on and to be independent from another person wiU often 
--- Page 192 ---
Structuring Treatment around Target Behaviors 173 
be the focus of treatment. As the patient begins to develop trust in the ther­
apist, she will generaUy begin to be more honest with the therapist about 
her need for help. During the initial stages of therapy, strong emphasis is put 
on reinforcing the patient for asking the therapist for help when the patient 
is having trouble coping with a particular situation. However, if this request 
for help is not transferred to other people in the patient's environment, and 
if the patient is not taught to render assistance to herself or self-soothe the 
termination of therapy will be extremely traumatic. The transition from reli­
ance on the therapist to reliance on self and others must begin almost im­
mediately. Once again, there is a dialectical emphasis on being able to rely 
on other people while leaming to be self-reliant. Thus, the goal is to be able 
to rely on oneself while remaining firmly within reciprocal interpersonal 
networks. 
Enhancing self-respea also requires the reduaion of self-hate and shame. 
In my experience, residual patterns of shame about oneself and one's past 
usuaUy surface during Stage 3 of therapy. In particular, the individual may 
need to work out how she will construe her own history and how she will 
present it to others. Especially if there is visible scarring, the patient must 
decide how to respond to queries about her past. At times, the re-emergence 
of intense shame or fears of terminating therapy may be such as to precipi­
tate a return of Stage 1 behaviors or Stage 2 stress reaaions. Usually, these 
relapses are brief. It is particularly important that the therapist not further 
shame the patient or overly pathologize the return of maladaptive behavior 
patterns. The situation is much like that of a smoker who stopped smoking 
5 years ago and is re-exposed to a cue strongly associated with smoking. If 
there have not been sufficient leaming experiences with that cue, the ex-smoker 
may experience an unexpeaed, intense urge to smoke. In DBT, one would 
suggest that a bit of new learning may be needed, rather than that the indiv-
dual has regressed. 
As between Stages 1 and 2, patients may sometimes take a break from 
therapy before or during Stage 3. At times, patients may enter other thera­
pies or work with other therapists during the intervals. There is no reason 
not to encourage this in DBT. 
Setting Priorities within Target Classes 
in Outpatient Individual Therapy 
As noted above, the individual psychotherapist in outpatient DBT is the 
primary therapist, and thus is responsible for organizing treatment to achieve 
aU primary treatment goals. The selection of behaviors to focus on within 
target classes, however, can at times be a challenge for the primary therapist. 
The hierarchies of behaviors within classes are outiined in Table 6.2 and are 
discussed below.

"Background suicide ideation is not targeted directly. It is seen as a by-product of quality-of-
life-interfering behaviors. 
Decreasing Suicidal Behaviors 
The first task of the individual therapist is to assess, keep track of, and focus 
treatment on the reduction of suicidal behaviors (see Chapter 5 for a full 
discussion). The particular DBT response to suicide crisis behaviors, however, 
depends on the assessed likelihood of suicide; the funaion of the behavior; 
the therapist's assessment of the patient's capabilities to change to more adap­
tive problem solving; and, most importantiy, which behaviors the therapist is 
wiUing to reinforce. Although suicide crisis behaviors are never ignored, this 
does not mean that the proper DBT response is always to "save" the patient. 
When parasuicidal acts occur, they are always discussed in the next in­
dividual psychotherapy session. The conduct of a detailed behavioral analy­
sis and subsequent solution analysis after every instance of parasuicide is a 
crucial aspect of DBT (see Chapter 9 for a description of these strategies). 
The only thing that would take precedence is suicide crisis behavior occur­
ring during the session. From my experience in consulting with therapists 
treating suicidal and/or borderiine patients, this refusal to allow parasuici­
dal behavior to occur unattended differentiates DBT from many other ap­
proaches to treating borderline patients. 
Intrusive or very intense suicide thoughts, images, and communications 
are addressed directiy in individual therapy sessions subsequent to their oc­
currence. However, unlike suicide crisis behaviors and parasuicidal aas, 
--- Page 194 ---
Structuring Treatment around Target Behaviors 175 
habitual or what I think of as "background" suicide ideation is not always 
addressed direcdy when it occurs. To do so would rule out attention to any 
other behavior for many borderline patients. For the most part, the assump­
tion in DBT is that ongoing suicide ideation is an outcome of low-quality 
lives; thus, the treatment consists of focused attention to enhancing the qual­
ity of Hfe (see below). 
Decreasing Therapy-Interfering Behaviors 
The second task in individual treatment is to deal with any behaviors that 
interfere with the therapy process. These behaviors are considered second in 
importance only to high-risk suicidal behaviors, including parasuicidal acts. 
Violations of terms for continuing therapy (e.g., missing 4 consecutive weeks 
of scheduled therapy) or other problems that threaten continuation for either 
the patient or the therapist take highest priority, of course. Next in impor­
tance are the following, in this order: 
1. Patient or therapist behaviors that interfere with the immediate process 
of treatment (e.g., the patient's not coming to therapy sessions, remaining 
mute in sessions, or engaging in behaviors that are so aversive to the ther­
apist that, if they do not stop, they will result in the therapist's terminating 
therapy; the therapist's making unreasonable or overly rigid demands that 
the patient cannot meet). 
2. Patient or therapist behaviors that are functionally related to suicide 
crisis behaviors or parasuicidal acts (e.g., the therapist's pushing too hard, 
too fast, or insensitively in topic areas that overwhelm the patient and often 
precipitate a suicidal crisis; the patient's retraaion of the agreement to work 
on reducing suicidal behaviors; the patient's fears of calling or confiding in 
the therapist before rather than after parasuicidal behaviors; the patient's 
threatening suicide in such a manner that it is too scary for the therapist not 
to overreaa, and/or the therapist's overreaction that further reinforce suici­
dal behaviors. 
3. Patient behaviors that mirror problem behaviors outside the therapist's 
office (hostUe, demanding remarks to the therapist simUar to interaaions with 
close family members; avoidance of difficult topics and problems similar to 
avoidance of problem solving outside of therapy). 
These problem behaviors, whether brought up by the patient or observed 
by the therapist, are addressed direaly whenever they occur They are not 
ignored. If a patient is engaging in multiple therapy interfering behaviors, the 
therapist may want to selea one or two for comment and ignore the others 
untU progress is made on the ones seleaed. One of the most common, but 
nonetheless harmful, mistakes that therapists make with borderline patients 
is to tolerate the patients' therapy-interfering behaviors untU it is too late. What 
often happens is that a patient engages in behaviors that frustrate both the 
--- Page 195 ---
176 TREATMENT OVERVIEW AND GOALS 
therapist and the therapy; the therapist says nothing about it direaly; and 
then suddenly the therapist hits his or her wall of tolerance, is burned out, 
and terminates the therapy unilaterally. UsuaUy, this is done in a way that 
makes it look as though the patient is at fault or the therapist had no choice. 
The patient is shocked, and begs for a chance to repair the relationship, but 
is not taken back. With some of our patients, this has happened repeatedly; 
no wonder that by the time they get to us they have little trust! 
The lack of progress as a therapy-interfering behavior should also be men­
tioned here. Clearly, if a patient is not progressing in therapy, this must be 
a primary target of therapeutic interactions. If progress still does not occur, 
therapy should be terminated at the end of the contracted period. That lack 
of progress will lead to therapy termination is often a new contingency for 
the patient. Indeed, a borderline patient's central fear is at times that if she 
does make progress, therapy will be terminated. Clarifying this switch in con­
tingencies is an important topic of initial therapy orientation. 
The central questions here in treating the borderline patient are these: 
How long should therapy continue without discernible progress toward goals; 
how much behavioral regression should be expeaed, especially when the pa­
tient is put on an extinction program; and how should progress be measured? 
Answers to these questions will be intimately tied to the therapist's theories 
of treatment, of behavioral functioning in general, and of BPD in particular. 
Borderline patients, relative to many other patients, often make very slow 
progress. For example, one study found that significant improvement in ad­
justment might require over 10 years to achieve (McGlashen, 1983), despite 
the fact that almost half of the patients were in therapy at the time of the 
follow-up assessment. At 5 years after the index diagnosis, borderline pa­
tients typically remain dysfunctional across many areas (Pope et al., 1983). 
The therapist must balance tolerance for slow progress in therapy with an 
openness to the possibility that the therapy he or she is offering is simply 
ineffective. 
Unfortunately, a patient often tolerates ineffective and at times iatrogen­
ic behaviors by the therapist for too long. We have had several patients who 
stayed in ineffective therapies and showed gradual but remarkable behavioral 
deterioration over time. Some stayed with therapists for over 10 to 12 years, 
and were still frequently engaging in parasuicidal acts and going in and out 
of hospitals monthly when they came into our program. Others tolerated ther­
apists who engaged in inappropriate sexual behaviors; used the patients as 
surrogate therapists for themselves; refused to respea the patients' knowledge 
of themselves or to modify the treatment in any way to fit the patients better; 
or interacted defensively and "blamed the victims," further undermining the 
patients' sense of competence and worth. These behaviors, if they should oc­
cur, are a primary focus of DBT treatment. As one might expect, the treat­
ment of the therapist by the DBT consultation supervisory group is often 
crucial here.

Decreasing Quality-of-Life-Interfering Behaviors 
The third set of targets for treatment consists of maladaptive behaviors that 
are serious enough to jeopardize any chance the patient has for a Hfe of 
reasonable quality. It is not unusual for patients to have more than one quality-
of-life-interfering behavior; several patients in my clinic have such problems 
in five or six areas. Guidelines for choosing which of these behaviors to work 
on in a given therapy session are as follows. First, behaviors that are immedi­
ate take priority. That is, if the patient has no money for food or housing 
now, focusing on financial issues takes precedence over working on substance 
abuse (unless, perhaps, the patient has spent the entire week in detoxification). 
Second, easy problems should be solved before hard problems. This strategy 
is intended mainly to increase the likelihood of reinforcement of aaive problem 
solving for the patient. The idea is that if the patient acquires some experience 
in solving problems, she will be more likely to work actively on solving larg­
er problems. 
Third, behaviors functionally related to higher-priority targets and to 
the patient's life goals take precedence. Loosely speaking, the order of im­
portance in working on these types of interfering behaviors (from high to low 
priority) is to address those functionally related to (1) suicide crisis behaviors 
and parasuicidal acts; (2) therapy-interfering behaviors; (3) suicide ideation 
and a sense of "misery"; (4) maintenance of treatment gains; and (5) other 
life goals of the patient. For example, if alcohol abuse is a reliable precursor 
of parasuicide, working on substance abuse should take precedence over in­
ability to complete a semester of school, which may be functionally related 
only to suicide ideation. If living on the streets is causally related to missing 
therapy sessions, finding housing should take precedence over getting a job, 
which may be funaionally related only to maintenance of treatment gains. 
And so on. Once again, principles of shaping determine pacing. 
Increasing Behavioral Skills 
Teaching behavioral skills (mindfulness, emotional regulation, interpersonal 
effectiveness, distress tolerance) is on the one hand intertwined with success 
in achieving the first three targets, and on the other hand constitutes a fourth 
independent treatment target in its own right. If the patient and therapist are 
to succeed in reducing the patient's suicidal, therapy-interfering, and quality-
of-life-interfering behaviors, those behaviors have to be replaced with some­
thing. That "something," in DBT, consists of the behavioral skills described 
briefly in Chapter 5 and in detail in the companion manual to this volume. 
The therapist must either pull skillful behaviors from the patient that she al­
ready possesses to some degree or teach her new ones. In either case, a sub­
stantial amount of energy must be focused on stregthening and generalization 
of behavioral skills, so that the patient can use those skills in contexts that 
previously elicited maladaptive, unskillful responses. 
--- Page 197 ---
178 TREATMENT OVERVIEW AND GOALS 
Borderline patients' unrelenting crises and mood dependency, as well as 
intense negative reactions to focusing sessions on teaching skills, can make 
it very difficult to structure the teaching of new behavioral skills into individual 
psychotherapy. These problems cannot be entirely avoided; one way or the 
other, the teaching must be accomplished. In my clinic, all new patients in 
individual psychotherapy also take part in 1 year of group skUls training. In 
this situation, the individual therapist during the first year focuses primarily 
on application of skills the patient is learning rather than on acquisition of 
new skills per se. The aim in individual therapy is to integrate these skUls 
into the patient's daily life and to increase the frequency of their use. 
This absence of a skill acquisition focus in individual therapy in our 
program is not a hard and fast rule. If a patient needs a skill that has not 
yet been covered in the skills training part of the therapy, then the individual 
therapist teaches the skill "ahead of time," so to speak. Also, if the patient 
misses several skills training sessions, and remedial teaching is not conducted 
by the skill trainers (as is often the case), the individual therapist may choose 
to teach the missed skills in individual therapy. Doing so will depend on the 
therapist's and patient's opinions about the funaional value of the skills in 
relationship to other target problems. 
In some situations, independent skills training may not be possible or 
even preferable. A patient's insurance may not pay for it; a group skills train­
ing program may not be running at the moment; avaUable skills training pro­
grams may be inappropriate for the patient; or the therapist may be isolated 
within a setting where independent skills training is not valued or supported. 
With well-functioning borderline patients (i.e., those entering therapy already 
well past Stage 1), or those eager to learn new skills and able to focus atten­
tion on doing so, there may be little need for separate skills training. When 
this is the case, the individual therapist can fold skills training into the in­
dividual psychotherapy. 
Once substantial progress has been made in achieving the first three tar­
gets, the therapist should assess whether the patient has sufficient behavioral 
skills to cope with the second stage of therapy, in which residual posttrau­
matic stress responses are treated. The key thing to remember is that the treat­
ment for posttraumatic stress is almost always traumatic in itself, as noted 
earlier. Therapy should not proceed until the therapist is reasonably sure that 
the patient has at least the mdimentary skills necessary to cope with that trau­
ma. Thus, if the teaching of new behavoral skills has been incidental to other 
aspects of individual therapy thus far, the therapist at this point may need 
to program a period of intensive focus on skill acquisition and strengthening 
before proceeding. In a sense, the therapist is fiUing in the "learning holes" 
before taking the next step. 
The therapist also must be alert to the re-emergence of first-stage 
problems (suicidal, therapy-interfering, and quality-of-life-interfering be­
haviors) in subsequent stages of therapy. When this happens, the focus on 
later-stage issues is momentarily suspended and the higher-order targets are 
--- Page 198 ---
Structuring Treatment around Target Behaviors 179 
readdressed. Treatment of posttraumatic stress will usuaUy fade into the last 
phase of therapy, where the primary target is remediating any residual problems 
with self-respect. 
Reducing Posttraumatic Stress 
The primary work on posttraumatic stress reduction is done in individual 
therapy, although joining anciUary groups for viaims of sexual or physical 
abuse or the like is encouraged for some. During the second stage of treat­
ment, DBT moves to a focus on previous sexual, physical, and emotional 
abuse, and neglect. This phase is also the time to focus on any other early 
chUdhood experiences, such as losses, "misfits," or other traumas that are relat­
ed to current stress responses. Thus, the second phase of individual therapy 
generally begins the "uncovering," cognitive and emotional processing, and 
resolution of pathogenic childhood events. Individual treatment wiU usually 
involve a heavy emphasis on exposure and cognitive modification strategies, 
focused on changing patients' emotional responses to trauma-related stimuli 
and cognitive reinterpretations of both the trauma and the patient's subse­
quent responses to the trauma. 
The four goals within this target area (accepting the facts of trauma; 
reducing stigmatization, self-invalidation, and self-blame; reducing denial and 
intrusive stress response pattems; and reducing dichotomous thinking about 
the traumatic situation) have been discussed in Chapter 5. In the ordinary 
case, these goals are worked on concurrently, with session focus dictated by 
problems that arise during the course of exposure to traumatic cues. 
Increasing Self-Respect and Achieving individual Goals 
During the final stage of individual therapy, self-respect is targeted. Since the 
greatest threats to self-respect for the borderline individual often originate 
in the social environment, treatment at this stage focuses primarily on self-
respect behaviors as they occur (or fail to occur) in the interpersonal rela­
tionship between the patient and the therapist. Attention to such behaviors 
requires a very close focus by the therapist on moment-to-moment interac­
tions between therapist and patient, as well as on the verbal, emotional, and 
overt behavioral responses of the patient. Generalization of newly acquired 
behavior pattems to the everyday world is targeted simultaneously. The treat­
ment at this point closely resembles psychodynamic as well as cHent-centered 
therapy, although the interpretations of behavior offered may differ substan­
tially between them. An even closer fit may be found between DBT at Stage 
3 and functional analytic psychotherapy (Kohlenberg & Tsai, 1991) 
Stage 3 is also the time for working on any other residual life problems 
the patient may want assistance with. At this point, goals are arrived at much 
as they are in any therapy Preferences of the patient and skills of the ther­
apist are most important. For example, I have had patients work on making 
--- Page 199 ---
180 TREATMENT OVERVIEW AND GOALS 
more friends, resolving problems at work, making career or later-in-life 
choices, and learning to cope with chronic physical pain. The work on self-
respect may thus be woven within the fabric of working on other issues. 
Using Target Priorities to Organize Sessions 
How an individual therapy session is used is determined by the patient's be­
haviors during the particular week preceding a session and/or during the ses­
sion itself. Two types of behaviors are relevant. The first consists of the patient's 
negative or problem behaviors—for example, committing parasuicidal aas, 
telephoning the therapist too much, spending the rent money on clothes, hav­
ing flashbacks of childhood sexual abuse, or invalidating her own point of 
view during the session. The second consists of positive behaviors that indi­
cate the patient's progress on a targeted behavior—for example, resisting strong 
urges to engage in parasuicide, coming to a session on time after being late 
many times previously, overcoming fears and applying for a job, using be­
havioral skills to confront a family member, or holding on to an opinion in 
the face of disapproval. Treatment time is oriented to current behaviors; the 
structure of the session is somewhat circular, in that target focal points revolve 
over time. 
The priority for attention during a given therapy interaction is determined 
by the hierarchical list (see Table 6.1). If either parasuicidal behaviors or sub­
stantial progress on such behaviors occurs during a particular week, atten­
tion to it takes precedence over attention to therapy-interfering behavior. In 
turn, a focus on therapy-interfering behaviors (both problems and progress) 
takes precedence over working on quality-of-life-interfering behaviors, and 
so on. Although more than one target behavior can often be worked on in 
a given therapy session, if time is short or a problem is complex a higher-
priority target always takes precedence, even if it means sHghting some other 
problem the patient or therapist wants to address in a session. Thus, the treat­
ment targets and their order of precedence determine to a large extent what 
is talked about in therapy sessions. The amount of time spent on a particular 
target, which can range from a simple highlighting comment by the therapist 
to an entire session devoted to a thorough analysis, depends on the valence 
of the behavior (positive or negative) and whether or not talking about the 
behavior is reinforcing. Naturally, the idea is to reinforce positive behaviors 
and to withhold reinforcement following negative behaviors. 
With respect to each target, the key task in problem solving is to elicit 
(at times, repeatedly) the patient's commitment to work on the target behavior. 
Every treatment strategy in DBT works better with cooperation from the pa­
tient. Thus, if the therapist is working on a behavioral target without the pa­
tient's aaive commitment to work on the same target, Httle progress is likely 
In my experience, obtaining at least the initial commitment is rarely difficult 
for suicidal behaviors. The long-term negative effects of parasuicide and sui­
cide are generally obvious to patients, and commitment to a goal of reducing 
--- Page 200 ---
Structuring Treatment around Target Behaviors 181 
such behavior is difficult to resist credibly. In any case, my colleagues and 
I simply do not accept patients in treatment if they do not agree that a goal 
of therapy is to reduce suicidal behaviors. (To date, only one has been re­
jected for this reason.) Thus, retraction of the commitment to work toward 
this goal at a later point would be considered a therapy-interfering behavior; 
as such, it would be second in importance only to the risk of imminent suicide. 
The necessity for being in therapy, if therapy is to work, is also self-
evident. And a logical case can usually be made that for therapy to continue, 
any therapy-interfering behaviors that arise have to be dealt with. The ra­
tionale given to the patient here is that if such behaviors are allowed to con­
tinue, the patient, the therapist, or both will build up resentment or burn 
out, and commitment to maintaining the therapeutic relationship wUl decrease. 
Since the therapeutic work is the glue that binds the relationship together, any 
behaviors that interfere with that work interfere with the relationship. Bor­
derline patients have often been unilaterally terminated from one or more ther­
apy regimens. Thus, a goal of developing and maintaining a working 
relationship with their therapist(s) is usually an attractive idea, at least at the 
beginning of therapy. 
Work on a target problem will involve a number of coordinated treat­
ment strategies, which are described in detail in the remainder of this book. 
At a minimum, the emergence of either the problem behavior or detectable 
progress is commented on by the therapist. Since determinants of problems 
and progress vary over time and situational context, each time the target 
problem behavior or substantial progress emerges, a behavioral analysis is 
usually conducted. For a negative behavior, the therapist analyzes, often in 
excruciating detail from the patient's point of view, what led up to the 
problematic response. For a positive behavior, the therapist analyzes exactly 
how the problem behavior was avoided. At the beginning of therapy, the con­
duct of such analyses may take up whole sessions, and little else will be ac­
complished. However, as therapy progresses the time needed to condua these 
analyses shortens, and the therapist can then move to solution analyses, which 
are analyses of how the patient could have prevented (or did prevent) the 
problem behavior. Such analyses may then lead to employment of any num­
ber of other treatment strategies to remediate problems functionally related 
to the targeted problem behavior. I describe how to work on a target behavior 
in much more detail when I discuss individual treatment strategies. One en­
tire strategy—the targeting strategy, which is a substrategy under the struc­
tural strategies—pertains to the allotment of treatment time and attention to 
various targets (see Chapter 14). 
Patient and Therapist Resistance to 
Discussing Target Behaviors 
The importance in DBT of focusing time and attention directly on target be­
haviors according to the hierarchical list cannot be overemphasized. It is a 
--- Page 201 ---
182 TREATMENT OVERVIEW AND GOALS 
defining characteristic of DBT. From my experience in teaching and super­
vising DBT, however, this aspect of treatment is one of the most difficult parts 
for many therapists. Usually, neither a patient nor a therapist wants to focus 
therapy on high-priority targets, for very good reasons. Discussion of high-
priority topics often leads to immediate aversive outcomes for patient and 
therapist alike. The therapist who is working alone, without support, is very 
likely to drift into a pattern of alternately appeasing and attacking the pa­
tient in regard to the issue of addressing these topics. When this pattern con­
tinues, therapy is likely to become so aversive that one or both parties terminate 
the relationship. Keeping the individual therapist focused on high-priority be­
haviors in a validating, problem-solving approach is the task of the DBT con­
sultation team. 
Patient Resistance 
Patients usually do not want to discuss their own dysfunctional behaviors in 
a problem-solving way. For example, I have never met a patient who likes 
to talk about previous parasuicidal acts during individual therapy sessions. 
A patient may want to discuss the problem that "caused" the behavior, or 
to have heart-to-heart discussions about her feelings about the behavior or 
the events surrounding the behavior. Rarely, however, does the patient want 
to discuss in moment-to-moment, second-by-second detail the behavioral and 
environmental events leading up to and following a parasuicidal aa, and then 
to generate a list of behaviors she could substitute for such an aa the next 
time. Some patients not only do not want to talk about suicidal behaviors; 
they also do not want to talk about anything associated with it. Often, these 
are emotion-phobic patients who are afraid that talking about the problems 
will expose them to overwhelming negative affect. 
Borderline patients may resist these discussions for any number of other 
reasons. Once parasuicidal behavior has occurred, patients often "move on" 
to new problems, so to speak. Focusing a discussion on past behavior does 
not address the current problems they may want to discuss in a therapy ses­
sion. At times, borderline patients feel too ashamed of their parasuicidal be­
havior to bear discussing it. Or the matter-of-faa, analytical approach to the 
behavior in DBT may make patients feel that their emotional suffering is be­
ing invalidated. The idea that other behaviors are possible may be interpreted 
as blame and criticism, leading to feelings of extreme anxiety, panic, or anger 
at the therapist. However, the point to be remembered here is that a discus­
sion is required every time parasuicidal behavior occurs between sessions. Non­
compliance with this treatment requirement is a therapy-interfering behavior 
(at least when the therapay is DBT), and thus should be the next issue dis­
cussed in the therapy session. 
Borderline patients do not usually want to discuss therapy-interfering be­
haviors either, at least not when their behaviors are the ones interfering. Rea­
sons for this reluaance are often simUar to the reasons given above for avoiding

discussions of parasuicide. Whether or not quality-of-life-interfering behaviors 
are desirable topics for discussion from a patient's point of view depends heav­
ily on whether the patient agrees that the behavioral pattern is problematic; 
if not, she can be expeaed to resist such discussions. At such points, it is 
important that the therapist be open to the possibility that he or she has mis-
assessed the actual effects of the behavior on the patient's life. If the behavior 
does not seriously interfere with the patient's chances of constructing a high-
quality life, then the behavior should not be high on the target list. Although 
there is room for true disagreement between patient and therapist, often the 
best direction for the therapist to take in such a situation is to find the syn­
thesis between both points of view. 
Patients also may not want to discus positive behaviors. Sometimes they 
have more pressing problems to discuss; in these instances, to reinforce the 
postive behavior, the patients' preference should probably take precedence. 
At other times, patients may fear that if success is noticed, more will be ex­
pected. Or patients may be uncomfortable with praise because they feel they 
do not deserve it. To many, progress threatens loss of therapy and of the ther­
apeutic relationship. Each of these latter instances is viewed as a therapy-
interfering behavior, and thus should be second in priority only to analyzing 
parasuicidal behaviors or suicide crisis behaviors that have occurred since the 
last session. As discussed in Chapter 10, controlling the focus of therapy dis­
cussions is a powerfful contingency management strategy. 
Therapist Resistance 
Some therapists find controlling the focus of sessions difficult in any case. 
This is especially true when therapists have been trained in nondireaive types 
of therapy. Some patients can make such control difficult for any therapist. 
These patients may withdraw and refuse to talk further in a session, continu­
ally respond to questions with "I don't know" or "It doesn't matter," threaten 
suicide, become extremely agitated or otherwise emotional, or react in any 
number of other ways that therapists find punishing. (All of these responses 
are instances of therapy-interfering behaviors, of course.) 
Some therapists do not want to hear about dysfunaional behaviors of 
their patients. Such reports might threaten their sense of competence or con­
trol as therapists, or remind them of behavioral problems of their own or 
of people close to them. One therapist I supervised told me that she didn't 
like to hear about "weird" behaviors from anyone. Other therapists are afraid 
they wiU make patients more suicidal if they force them to talk about things 
they are reluctant to discuss, especially suicidal behavior. Still others feel that 
the patients are in enough misery; why make it worse by forcing the topic 
of discussion? These reaaions by therapists are viewed in DBT as therapy-
interfering behaviors: They may make patients feel better in the short term, 
but long-term change requires that patients' high-priority problem behaviors 
be dealt with directly. 
--- Page 203 ---
184 TREATMENT OVERVIEW AND GOALS 
Interestingly, many therapists are also reluctant to discuss patients' 
therapy-interfering behaviors direaly with the patients. In my supervision ex­
perience, many therapists put off discussing such behaviors with patients un­
til they are burned out and it is too late. The problems are brought up in 
supervision, but not easily with the patients. GeneraUy, these therapists seem 
to believe that "nontherapeutic" responses to patients (e.g., feelings of anger, 
burnout, reluctance to continue treatment) are indications of their own in­
adequacies. By contrast, DBT approaches such responses as indications that 
there are problems in the therapeutic relationship —that is, therapy-interfering 
behaviors are going on. With very few exceptions, such problems are discussed 
with patients in a direct, problem-solving manner. More is said on this topic 
in Chapters 9 and 15. Like patients, therapists often do not want to discuss 
or work on their own therapy-intefering behaviors, either. Indeed, some ther­
apists are quite adept at turning patients' complaints about their own behavior 
into discussions of the patients' excessive demands, oversensitivity, or the like. 
Individual Therapy Targets and Diary Cards 
How does a therapist come to know about parasuicidal and other targeted 
behaviors that occur during the week between sessions? Certainly, the ther­
apist can ask. This is a simple thing to do when negative high-priority be­
haviors are occurring often or positive behaviors are occurring infrequently. 
For example, if a person enters therapy cutting herself daily, and wants help 
in stopping the cutting, it is easy for the therapist to ask about self-mutilation 
at the beginning of each session. However, in my experience, it gets increas­
ingly difficult for the therapist to ask about such behavior after it has not 
occurred for a number of weeks or months. Likewise, if drug or alcohol use 
is not a problem at the moment, the therapist may feel uncomfortable or silly 
asking about it each and every week. If increased use of behavioral skiUs is 
a focus, but the patient is dUigently applying such skills week after week, 
it may be difficult to ask for a progress report every single week. But, in my 
experience, problems with drugs and alcohol are very unlikely to be reported 
spontaneously Parasuicide may or may not be reported, depending on whether 
the function of the act is communication to the therapist. And once the pa­
tient forgets to work at applying behavioral skills, she is unlikely to report 
this to the therapist as a problem. 
The easiest solution to these difficulties is to have the patient fill out a 
diary card each and every week, in order to obtain information on a daily 
basis about relevant behaviors. The front of a DBT diary card is shown in 
Figure 6.1. As can be seen, information is obtained about type and amount 
of alcohol ingested each day; types and amounts of prescription, over-the-
counter, and illicit drugs taken; and degree of suicide ideation, degree of mis­
ery, degree of urges to commit parasuicidal acts, and occurrence of such acts. 
A rating for amount of behavioral skills practice is also obtained each day 
The card can be used for a variety of purposes, but one major purpose is

186 TREATMENT OVERVIEW AND GOALS 
to elicit information about targeted behaviors that have occurred during the 
previous week. If the card indicates that a parasuicidal aa has occurred, it 
is noted and discussed. If very high suicide ideation is indicated, it is assessed 
to determine whether the patient is at high risk for suicide. If a pattern of 
excessive alcohol or drug use appears, it is discussed (as a quality-of-life-
interfering behavior). Failure to take prescribed drugs may be a therapy-
interfering behavior. If the card is not brought in or is inadequately fiUed out, 
this constitutes a therapy-interfering behavior and, of course, is discussed as 
such. Finally, there are blank columns for recording any other behaviors that 
the patient and therapist may decide upon. Generally, at least at the begin­
ning of therapy, these columns are used to record other quality-of-life-
interfering behaviors. For example, I have had patients record hours per day 
at work, hours per day fantasizing, bulimic episodes, amount of exercise, num­
ber of urges to avoid situations that are resisted, and number of dissociative 
experiences. 
Patients fill out diary cards during at least the first two stages of therapy. 
As problems with parasuicide and substance abuse are resolved, patients gener­
ally resist continuing to fill out the cards. However, since there is a high likeli­
hood that these behaviors will return during work on posttraumatic stress, 
diary cards should not be stopped until the third phase. At that point, con­
tinuation is a matter of negotiation between patient and therapist. This is 
not to say that a fair amount of negotiation does not take place during the 
end of the first phase and throughout the second phase of therapy. As pa­
tients learn more assertion skUls, they can be expected to use these skUls in 
therapy more frequently. Diary cards afford an almost perfea vehicle for this 
praaice. I have one patient who, on general principle, refuses to fill out diary 
cards when I am out of town. She reasons that if I am on vacation, she should 
also be allowed to go on vacation. This seems reasonable to me. 
Skills Training: Hierarchy of Targets 
By definition, skills training has as its primary focus the acquisition and 
strengthening of behavioral skUls. SkUls training in DBT has four distina mod­
ules covering mindfulness, distress tolerance, interpersonal effectiveness in con-

F. Mood dependency of behavior 
flict situations, and emotion regulation. The order of targets for skills train­
ing is given in Table 6.3. The targets and their ordering are reviewed in de­
tail in the companion manual to this volume; thus, I do not discuss them 
here. The important point, however, is that the target hierarchy in skills train­
ing is not the same as that in individual psychotherapy. 
Supportive Process Groups: Hierarchy of Targets 
In contrast to skills training, where very little direct attention is given to in-
session process issues, supportive process group therapy in DBT utilizes the 
behaviors that occur during group meetings —that is, the group process—as 
the vehicle for change. Thus, the principal targets are in-session behaviors 
that exemplify in some way the problems each patient is having outside of 
group meetings. This comparability is crucial if the therapy is to be effec­
tive. Teaching patients to behave as good group members when those same 
behaviors are not functional in their everyday lives does them a disservice. 
Because the agenda in process groups is far less strialy controUed by the group 
therapists than in any other mode of DBT, the hierarchy of targets is less 
rigidly adhered to. However, through orienting patients to treatment and 
through in-session comments and questions, therapists can have some in­
fluence on the therapeutic focus as well as on which behaviors are reinforced. 
The hierarchy of process group targets is outiined in Table 6.4. The 
most important target class is that of therapy-interfering behaviors (e.g., not 
coming to sessions, coming late, missing for unimportant reasons, not keep­
ing agreements, violating group rules, withdrawing, attacking others, etc.). 
In individual DBT and skiUs training groups, therapists take primary respon­
sibUity for addressing these issues. In the process group, by contrast, therapy-
interfering behaviors of group members or of the group therapists offer an 
opportunity for patients to work on the second most important target-
strengthening use of interpersonal skUls, especially in the resolution of con­
flia situations. The third target class includes any other behavioral patterns 
exhibited in group interaaions that, outside of the group, would interfere

Calls to the individual therapist:

Calls to the skills trainer or other therapists: 
1. Decreasing behaviors likely to destroy therapy 
with (behaviors to decrease) or enhance (behaviors to increase) the quality 
of life for a particular patient. Two points must be attended to. First, the fo­
cus in on behaviors that show up within the therapy session, not on outside 
events or behaviors. Second, the particular behaviors stressed and reinforced, 
punished, or extinguished are specific to each patient. That is, not every tar­
get is necessarily accorded the same importance for each patient. 
Telephone Calls: Hierarchy of Targets 
Targets for phone conversations with a patient depend on whether a call is 
made to the primary therapist or to a skills training or ancillary therapist. 
The hierarchy of targets is outlined in Table 6.5. 
Calls to the Primary Therapist 
Telephone calls between sessions to the primary therapist are encouraged in 
DBT. (A therapist who is immediately worried about getting too many calls, 
however, should remember that a patient's calling too often is considered 
therapy-interfering behavion) To understand the hierarchy of targets for phone 
calls, the primary therapist needs to remember the three reasons why DBT 
favors phone calls. First, for the individual who has difficulty asking for help 
directly, and instead attempts suicide as a "cry for help" or otherwise suffers 
adverse consequences as a result of her difficulty, the very act of telephoning 
is practice in changing this dysfunaional behavior. It offers the therapist an 
avenue to intervene to stop suicidal behavion 
Second, a patient often needs help in generalizing DBT behavioral skills 
to her everyday life. A phone call can obtain the coaching needed for success­
ful generalization. In DBT, the primary therapist is much like a high school 
basketball coach. Individual psychotherapy sessions are like the daily, after-
school practice sessions where fiindamentals are taught and attention is given 
to building the basic skills for the game. Phone calls, in contrast, are like the 
interaction of the coach with team members during an actual competitive 
game. The coach helps team members remember and apply what they have 
learned during the weekly practice sessions. In sports, it is inconceivable that 
a coach would refiise to go to games and help team members. No coach would 
suggest that this is not part of the job, that helping players during games is 
--- Page 208 ---
Structuring Treatment around Target Behaviors 189 
making them dependent, or that asking for advice during the game is a hostile 
attack on the coach. 
Third, when interpersonal conflicts or crises arise in an intimate rela­
tionship, it does not seem reasonable that the person having difficulty has 
to wait an arbitrary amount of time, set by the other person, to resolve the 
crises. Phone calls in these instances offer an opportunity to increase the in­
terpersonal bonding between patient and therapist, but they also offer an op­
portunity to equalize the power distribution in therapy. As other therapy 
perspectives would put it, such calls "empower" the patient. 
These three reasons for phone calls dictate the targets for such caUs. In 
order of importance, these are as follows: (1) decreasing suicide crisis be­
haviors; (2) increasing application of skills to everyday life; and (3) resolving 
interpersonal crises, alienation, or a sense of distance between patient and 
therapist. As in other interactions with a borderline patient, it can at times be 
extremely difficult for the therapist to keep a phone session on track. With 
respect to suicide crisis behaviors, the main focus is on assessing risk and 
using a problem-solving approach to identify alternative behaviors. General­
ly, such problem solving will lead into a discussion of how the patient can 
apply DBT behavioral skills to the current situation. Or, if the problem is 
the relationship with the therapist, a discussion of this may ensue. However, 
keeping the patient alive in a crisis generally takes precedence over other targets. 
With respea to skiU generalization, the modal comment of the DBT ther­
apist on a phone call is "What skills could you use in this instance?" Thus, 
the therapist relentlessly keeps the focus on how the patient can use her skills 
to cope with the current problem until she has another session. At least at 
the beginning of treatment, getting the patient to utilize distress tolerance (in­
cluding crisis survival) skills is the primary goal here. Analyzing the current 
crisis and generating solutions is a focus of therapy sessions but not of phone 
sessions; resolving the problem or crisis is definitely not the target of phone 
sessions. It is crucial that the therapist remember and attend to this point, 
since problem resolution is usually the patient's primary objective during the 
phone call. 
A borderline patient often feels angry, alienated, or distant from her ther­
apist; therapy sessions frequentiy set off these feelings. However, such a pa­
tient also often has delayed reactions to interactions with the therapist. Thus, 
emotions of anger, sadness, alienation, or other distress may not occur until 
some time after an interaction. Calling the therapist is appropriate in this sit­
uation. The target of these calls, from the DBT point of view, is a decrease 
in the patient's sense of alienation or distance from the therapist. The difficulty 
for the therapist is helping the patient with this issue while not reinforcing 
dysfunctional behaviors at the same time. I discuss this issue in much greater 
detaU in Chapter 15. In the beginning of therapy, phone interactions not only 
may be frequent, but also may last a fair amount of time. The therapeutic 
strategies of observing limits, discussed in Chapter 10, can be especiaUy crit­
ical here if the therapist is not to burn out. As therapy progresses and trust 
--- Page 209 ---
190 TREATMENT OVERVIEW AND GOALS 
in the relationship increases, both the frequency and duration of calls should 
decrease. 
Calls to Skills Trainers and Other Therapists 
Although the skiUs trainer might seem to be the logical person to call for 
help in applying behavioral skills to everyday life, in DBT, where skills train­
ing is conducted in groups, the patient is instead directed to call the individu­
al therapist for this purpose. Generally, the individual therapist will have a 
much better appreciation of the patient's current abilities and limitations, and 
thus will be in a better position to require and reinforce "just-noticeable im­
provement." In other settings, this limitation on phone calls and ancillary con­
taa may not be necessary. For example, if an individual skills training model 
is used, it may make sense for the patient to be able to call the skUls trainer 
for help in applying specific behavior skills outside of treatment sessions. If 
milieu treatment is used, as is typical in inpatient and day treatment settings, 
consultations for help in skill generalization might ordinarily be directed to 
milieu staff. In these instances, the second target is application of skills to 
everyday life. 
In my program, the only purpose of a call from the skills trainer's point 
of view is to keep the patient in skills training—that is, to decrease any be­
havior that threatens the continuation of therapy. Obviously, keeping the pa­
tient alive is useful to achieving this target goal. A similar position is taken 
by other therapists in the DBT program, including the program direaor. The 
only appropriate focus is on those problems that threaten the patient's con­
tinuation in the program. All other problems are handled by the individual 
therapist. 
If a patient calls the skills trainer or any other therapist, including the 
program or unit director, for help in a crisis or for help in applying skUls 
to a situation, that therapist will refer her to her individual therapist and will 
help the patient with distress tolerance skills until her therapist is available. 
If the patient is in immediate danger of suicide, the therapist does what is 
needed to insure the patient's safety and then turns the problems over to the 
individual therapist. A more detailed discussion of these points is provided 
in the accompanying skiUs training manual. 
Target Behaviors and Session Focus: 
Who Is in Control? 
When the patient does not want to discuss high-priority target behaviors, the 
therapist is faced with controlling the therapy focus against the patient's wishes. 
DBT requires that the therapist adhere resolutely to the target hierarchy for 
the particular type of session being conducted. Although at times such a fo­
cus can create a power struggle that derails attention to other pressing 
problems, this does not need to be the case. The therapist must remember 
--- Page 210 ---
Structuring Treatment around Target Behaviors 191 
and attend to a number of points. The most important one is that the ther­
apist must believe in attending directly to high-priority behaviors. That is, 
the therapist must believe in the value of applying problem-solving approaches 
to such behaviors. Clearly, the patient usually does not believe in this ap­
proach, and frequently punishes persistence and reinforces moving on to other 
topics. If the therapist also does not believe in confronting the problem be­
haviors directly, it is very difficult to resist the patient's pressure to attend 
to other topics. The solution here is for the therapist to keep a resolute focus 
on long-term gain rather than short-term peace during the session (i.e., the 
therapist practices the crisis survival strategies taught to the patient in the 
distress tolerance module of skills training). 
Although high-priority behaviors do not have to be the very first topics 
discussed during a session, they nonetheless cannot be ignored. If the therapist 
agrees to discuss something other than these behaviors, he or she may unwit­
tingly be reinforcing avoidance behaviors; by insisting on discussing the high-
priority behaviors, the therapist is extinguishing avoidance behaviors. At times 
a patient will respond to the therapist's insistence by withdrawing, refusing 
to speak, attacking the therapist or therapy, or other behaviors that can be 
loosely described as "throwing a behavioral tantrum." If these behaviors 
work—that is, if the therapist is dissuaded from discussing the high-priority 
behaviors by these patient responses—the therapist is then rewarding the pa­
tient's often dysfunaional style of resistant behaviors. It is much like trying 
to help a person lost in a snowstorm who has hypothermia and wants to lie 
down and sleep. A good friend will do what is necessary to keep the hypo­
thermia victim moving. (This metaphor can be useful in gaining cooperation 
from the reluctant patient.) 
As I discuss in more detaU in Chapter 10, the key here is the combina­
tion of unwavering nonappeasement with equally unwavering soothing. Sooth­
ing, in this instance, may consist of orienting the patient to the importance 
of discussing the high-priority behaviors, reminding the patient of her com­
mitment to work on the behaviors, compromising on both timing and amount 
of time spent on unwanted topics, and validating her difficulties with such 
an approach. Unwavering nonappeasement means continuing with the be­
havioral and solution analyses, taking each response of the patient at face 
value, and staying on track, but all the while responding with warmth and 
attention. In my experience, once a patient learns the rules and knows that 
without exception the therapist wiU not avoid high-priority behaviors in ther­
apy, one of two things happens: Either the patient makes enough progress 
on the behaviors that they do not have to be discussed, or she cooperates 
with the therapeutic guidelines. 
Modification of Target Hierarchies in Other Settings 
There is no a priori reason why the particular targets or divisions of targets 
desaibed above must be invariant. The hierarchies desaibed here have worked 
--- Page 211 ---
192 TREATMENT OVERVIEW AND GOALS 
well in an outpatient treatment setting; however, in other treatment settings, 
modification in the divisions of targets and orderings of importance may be 
indicated. Any program that develops treatment plans with specified behavioral 
targets is compatible with a DBT approach. In many settings, however, treat­
ment targets will necessarUy be much more limited than in the full DBT pro­
gram, although reduaion of suicide risk and reduaion of therapy-destructive 
behaviors have to be primary targets in any setting. 
Responsibility for Decreasing Suicidal Behaviors 
In my view, the primary therapist should always give first priority to the reduc­
tion of suicidal behaviors, including parasuicide. That is, this target cannot 
be downplayed or ignored by the primary therapist. On an acute unit, the 
person whose chief responsibUity it is to help the patient decrease suicidal 
behaviors may be the individual contact person, or any other person who 
is reasonably familiar with the patient. Because of the short-term nature of 
an acute unit, the designated person may be whoever fills a particular role 
rather than a specific individual. For example, the primary contact person 
may change every day, or may stay the same each day but change with each 
shift. If the individual's outpatient therapist is also her attending therapist 
on the inpatient unit, that therapist is the ideal person. In day treatment, the 
designated person may be the case manager. The point here is that if suicidal 
behavior occurs or is threatened while the person is receiving treatment in 
the setting, DBT treatment strategies focus directly on the behavior need to 
be implemented by someone. Such behavior should not be ignored. 
In my clinic, the individual psychotherapist is the only person who direaly 
targets reducing suicidal behaviors. All other treatment team members do the 
minimum necessary to keep the patient alive. In addition, they may utUize 
suicidal or parasuicidal crises as opportunities to help the patient with skill 
implementation (e.g., stress tolerance instead of parasuicidal activity until she 
can see her individual contaa person). Otherwise, all members of the treat­
ment team send the patient to the individual psychotherapist for extensive 
work on suicidal behavior, including crisis management. 
Others using DBT have developed different systems. For example, all 
milieu therapists (nurses, mental health technicians, etc.) may respond to sui­
cidal or parasuicidal behavior with immediate application of problem-solving 
strategies. If patient-staff community meetings are a part of treatment, the 
entire unit may target parasuicide episodes. Reviewing the behavioral and so­
lution analyses (see Chapter 9) of any parasuicidal activities that week, for 
example, may be part of the weekly agenda. In process group sessions fol­
lowing parasuicidal behavior, the entire group may assist in such analyses. 
Even if the targets are kept entirely as I have described above for outpatient 
DBT, who is responsible for which targets will vary by treatment location and 
setting. In principle, there is nothing in DBT that prohibits these changes if 
each segment of the treatment team has a clear and specific understanding 
--- Page 212 ---
Structuring Treatment around Target Behaviors 193 
of its targets, its limits, and its rules. The most relevant principle here, as I 
discuss in Chapters 10 and 15, is to apply change strategies that do not simul­
taneously reinforce the behaviors therapy is intended to reduce. 
Responsibility for Other Targets 
Depending on the setting and the length of treatment available, treatment 
tai^ets may be a blend of general targets for all patients in the setting (e.g., 
increasing skills taught in groups everyone participates in) and individual­
ized targets developed for each patient. For example, each patient may have 
her own set of targeted quality-of-life-interfering behaviors. In my experience, 
an important quality-of-life-interfering behavior that can be usefully targeted 
on acute inpatient units is active passivity with respect to finding affordable 
housing or coping with other crises situations. Because suicidal behaviors can 
recur as a result of initial attempts to treat posttraumatic stress due to sexual 
abuse, especially when the treatment strategy involves exposure to stress cues, 
an inpatient unit is often an ideal environment for at least much of the early 
work on this target. A structured substance abuse setting will, of course, have 
decreasing substance abuse as a primary target. Many settings other than out­
patient therapy also target some variation of the behavioral skills taught in 
DBT. It is not unusual, for example, to have life skills classes and groups for 
teaching assertion, cognitive skills for reducing depression, anger manage­
ment, and the like. 
Specifying Targets for Other Modes of Treatment 
As I have said, DBT modes in my clinic include individual psychotherapy, 
group skills training, supportive process group therapy, telephone calls, and 
therapist case consultations. In some settings, however, other modes of treat­
ment may be very important. For example, on inpatient and day treatment 
units there is a milieu mode of treatment. Patient-staff community meetings 
constitute another mode. Vocational counseling, "wellness" or exercise classes, 
high school classes, and others may be important modes of treatment in some 
settings. In community mental health settings, case management, crisis out­
reach, and emergency room management are often important modes. The 
essential idea here is that regardless of the mode of treatment being provid­
ed, it is imperative to list cleariy and in order the targets of each mode. This 
does not mean that there cannot be overlap between modes. For example, 
both crises outreach and emergency room management may target reducing 
immediate suicide crises behaviors and, secondarily, skills generalization. 
In one long-term inpatient hospital unit, directed by Charies Swenson 
at Cornell Medical Center/New York Hospital at White Plains, DBT skills 
training groups are a regular part of the therapy. In addition, a unit skUls 
consultant has been designated (a new mode of treatment). This consultant 
has daily office hours, and patients can go to him or her with questions and 
--- Page 213 ---
194 TREATMENT OVERVIEW AND GOALS 
problems regarding the application of their new skUls in everyday life in the 
hospital. Thus, generalization of behavioral skUls is the primary target for 
the consultant, rather than a target for the individual psychotherapist. Such 
an approach may be particularly useful when individual psychotherapists do 
not themselves provide DBT. 
DBT is nonetheless increasingly being applied in mUieu settings. The suc­
cess of the application in such a setting is closely linked to the unit's ability 
to think clearly about the milieu's behavioral targets and to organize DBT 
treatment strategies to address these targets. The hierarchical list of targets 
for milieu interactions might be as follows: (1) preventing parasuicide and sui­
cide; (2) deaeasing behaviors that interfere with unit funaioning and cohesive­
ness; (3) increasing generalization of DBT behavioral skills to on-unit inter­
actions; and (4) decreasing quality-of-life-interfering behaviors and increas­
ing quality-of-life-enhancing behaviors as these behaviors occur on the unit. 
The limits of an inpatient unit with respect to suicidal and therapy-
interfering behaviors may be quite different from those of an individual psy­
chotherapist. Outright control of their behavior may be more important, if 
only because society expeas behavior to be controlled in such a setting. Thus, 
milieu staff members may develop rules and contingencies for behavior that 
differ from those set by the individual psychotherapists. These rules may reflea 
the milieu staffs need to target the welfare of the entire unit, as well as that 
of each individual patient. It is more than likely that a more precise and 
context-specific set of therapy-interfering behaviors will be needed to assist 
staff members in pinpointing when these behaviors (by either staff or patients) 
are occurring. In a long-term inpatient setting, the milieu may have primary 
responsibility for increasing skill generalization. In such a setting, a patient 
may more appropriately call on the milieu staff than on her individual psy­
chotherapist. As in supportive process group therapy, the value of this ap­
proach depends heavily on a similarity between behaviors that work on the 
unit and behaviors that work in the outside world. Teaching a patient to be 
a good patient is not in itself a very useful target for the borderline individu­
al. Indeed, in my experience, many borderline individuals have this role down 
very well. 
In milieu and other institutional settings, there will be at least one or­
ganizational leader and sometimes many more. In such settings, the treat­
ment targets of these individuals need to be specified. Usually, they will be 
responsible for patients' and therapists' observation of unit or organizational 
limits. They also are generally responsible for the therapists' behaviors; thus, 
they target delivery of DBT by the therapists. 
Turf Conflicts with Respect to Target Responsibilities 
As I have discussed in Chapter 4, the mode of DBT for the therapist is the 
weekly case consultation/supervision meeting. In my experience, if this is weU 
--- Page 214 ---

attended and if the entire treatment team accepts the spirit of DBT and its 
dialeaical framework, little conflia about target responsibilities emerges. The 
key to this cooperation is clarity about which treatment targets are specific 
to which modes of treatment, as well as clarity about the hierarchy of targets 
in each mode of treatipent. For example, in standard DBT as delivered in my 
clinic, skiUs trainers must understand clearly that decreasing parasuicidal and 
high-risk suicidal behaviors is not their top-priority target; rather, it is that 
of the primary therapist. Thus, when such behavior is threatened, a skills 
trainer calls or refers the patient to her primary therapist, instead of working 
out a no-harm contract on the spot or sending the patient to the hospital. 
A second component of cooperation, as I discuss in Chapter 13, is the 
philosophy of DBT that team members do not have to agree, say the same 
things to patients, or be particularly consistent with patients. Thus, if two 
team members focus on teaching interpersonal skills and teach opposite be­
haviors, it is the responsibUity of the patient (with help from the primary ther­
apist, if needed) to sort out what to learn and what to discard. A third aspect 
of keeping the team on track is mutual respect among team members. Dia­
lectical and problem-solving strategies are applied when conflicts arise. 
However, defensiveness and judgmental attitudes can quickly derail such 
efforts. 
In contrast, patients' use of ancillary treatment is rife with possibilities 
for conflict. A psychologist consulted for behavioral work on a specified 
problem —for example, desensitization of fear of flying—may expand treat­
ment to target general fears and problems with passivity and avoidance. A 
pharmacotherapist may decide that another mode of treatment is required 
for depression or suicidal ideation (e.g., hospitalization), without referring 
the patient back to her primary therapist. A member of the inpatient hospi­
tal staff may develop an entirely different treatment plan and send the pa­
tient to a new outpatient therapist. Although DBT seeks to control the 
treatment priorities of the DBT team, it has no necessary agenda for directly 
influencing treatment priorities of ancillary therapists. The consultation-to-
the-patient approach, which puts the burden of influence on the patient, is 
used here. I discuss this much more extensively in Chapter 13. 
Concluding Connments 
Struauring therapy in DBT requires two things: a clear understanding of what 
stage of therapy a patient is in, and a clear understanding of the specific tar­
gets with this specific patient and of how those targets relate to the total treat­
ment picture. Even when you are a patient's only therapist, you must 
understand your goals and make them clear during each interaction with the 
patient. Once you have achieved this clarity, you have to get yourself to fol­
low the treatment guidelines. It is this aspect of the treatment that has proved 
to be the most difficult for many therapists. It is probably impossible to fol-
--- Page 215 ---
196 TREATMENT OVERVIEW AND GOALS 
low the treatment guidelines in this chapter unless you believe firmly in them. 
Once you believe in them, you have to take a protective stance toward the 
patient and be unwilling to allow continued pain and dysfunction. As one 
of my students said about doing DBT, you have to be "warmly ruthless" in 
your determination to help the patient change. It also helps (if you are em­
pirically minded) to remember the empirical data on the efficacy of the 
treatment.

Dialectical Treatment 
Strategies 
D BT treatment strategies are coordi­
nated activities, tactics, and procedures that the therapist employs to achieve 
the treatment goals described in Chapters 5 and 6. Strategies also describe 
the role and focus of the therapist and may refer to coordinated responses 
that the therapist should give to a particular problem presented by the pa­
tient. The term "strategies" in DBT means the same thing as terms such as 
"procedures," "protocol," and "techniques" in other treatment approaches. I 
prefer the term "strategies" because it implies both a plan of aaion and finesse 
in carrying out the plan. Although each set of strategies has a number of com­
ponents, not all of these are required in every instance. It is more important 
to apply the intent of a group of strategies than to adhere rigidly to the exact 
guidelines as presented here. In this seaion of the book, I define and outline 
the major strategies in DBT. 
Basic treatment strategies in DBT are depicted in Figure 7.1. They are 
grouped into four major categories: (1) dialectical strategies, (2) core strate­
gies, (3) stylistic strategies, and (4) case management strategies. (Specific in­
tegrative strategies, which involve various combinations of sttategies from these 
four categories, are discussed in the last two chapters of this book.) Dialecti­
cal strategies are pervasive and inform the entire treatment. The core strate­
gies consist of problem-solving and validation strategies; as the label "core 
strategies" implies, they are at the heart of the treatment, together with dialec­
tical strategies. Stylistic strategies specify interpersonal and communication 
styles compatible with the therapy. Case management strategies have to do 
with how the therapist interacts with and responds to the social network in 
which the patient is enmeshed. With specific patients, some strategies will be 
used more often than others, and it is possible that one or more of the strateg­
ies wiU be needed only rarely. Not all strategies may be necessary or appropri­
ate for any given session, and the pertinent combination may change over time.

FIGURE 7.1. Treatment strategies in DBT. 
The strategies described in this and the following chapters no doubt have 
many things in common with aspeas of the other varieties of psychotherapy 
currently in use. To the extent that those who develop therapy models learn 
how to do therapy from their patients—that is, what works and what does 
not—there should be many overlaps among the various approaches to work­
ing with simUar types of patients and problems. Although the formulation 
of how and why a particular treatment approach works with borderline pa­
tients may differ across theoretical orientations, the therapeutic behaviors that 
are actually effective as probably much less variable. In writing the original 
draft of this volume, I read every other treatment manual I could find, both 
behavioral and nonbehavioral. I also read books that tell new therapists how 
they are supposed to behave in therapy. My intent was to see how others 
described the behaviors specific to their treatment. Whenever I found a treat­
ment component or strategy that was the same as or similar to one used in 
DBT, I tried to use similar language to describe it. Thus, in a sense, much 
of this manual has been "stolen" from preceding manuals. When I give work­
shops on DBT, a very common response from therapists, regardless of their 
theoretical orientation, is that I am telling them what they already do with 
borderline patients. Thus, I suspect that many therapists will find much of 
their own therapeutic behavior described in these chapters.

Dialectical Treatment Strategies 201 
Defining Dialectical Strategies 
Dialectical strategies permeate all aspects of treatment in DBT. These strate­
gies grow out of a dialectical philosophical position (discussed more fuUy 
in Chapter 2) that views reality as a wholistic process in a state of constant 
development and change. Dialectical strategies stress the creative tensions 
generated by contradiaory emotions and oppositional thought patterns, 
values, and behavioral strategies, both within the person and in the person-
environment system. As I have noted repeatedly throughout this book, the 
primary therapy dialectic is that of change in the context of acceptance of 
reality as it is. The therapist facilitates change by responding strategically to 
optimize the dialectical tensions arising within therapeutic interactions, and 
by highlighting each side of the dialectical oppositions arising in therapy 
interactions as well as in everyday Hfe. The object is to foster successive 
reconciliation and resolution at increasingly functional and viable levels. 
Rigid adherence to either pole of a dialectic by therapist or patient contrib­
utes to stagnation, increases tension, and inhibits reconcUiation and syn­
thesis.' 
The dialectical focus of the therapist involves two levels of therapeutic be­
havior Although they may occur simultaneously, they are very different in their 
point of view and in their application. First, the therapist is alert to the dialec­
tical tensions and balance occurring within the treatment relationship itself. 
From this perspective, the focus is on the therapeutic interaction and on 
movement within that relationship. The therapist pays attention to the di­
aleaics of the relationship by combining acceptance and change strategies 
and by moving back and forth within the current dialectic during each inter­
aaion in such a way as to maintain a collaborative working relationship with 
the patient. 
Second, the therapist teaches and models dialectical behavior patterns. 
From this perspeaive, the focus is on the patient, independent of her interac­
tions with the therapist. The strategies in ths case include direaly teaching 
the patient; questioning her in order to open up new avenues of behavior; 
offering alternative ways of thinking and behaving; and, most importantly, 
modeling dialeaical behavior. The message communicated to the patient is 
that truth is neither absolute nor relative, but rather evolves and is construct­
ed over time. Thus, it is not possible at one point in time to grasp the totality 
of the truth in any state of affairs. Either extreme of a dialeaic, by defini­
tion, is not the place to be. No rigid position is possible, and process and 
change are inevitable. Teaching dialectical patterns of thinking is essentially 
an application of cognitive restruauring procedures (see Chapter 11), with 
a specific focus on replacing nondialectical with dialeaical thinking and un­
derlying assumptions. Both attention to the dialectics of the therapeutic rela­
tionship and teaching dialectical behavior patterns are essential in every 
interaction with the patient; they also inform the treatment supervision and 
case consultation meetings.

202 BASIC TREATMENT STRATEGIES 
BALANCING TREATMENT STRATEGIES: 
DIALECTICS OF THE THERAPEUTIC RELATIONSHIP^ 
The primary dialeaical strategy is the balanced use of specific strategies and 
therapeutic positions by the therapist during interactions with the patient. 
Constant attention to combining acceptance with change, flexibility with sta­
bility, nurturing with challenging, and a focus on capabilities with a focus 
on limitations and deficits is the essence of this strategy. The goal is to bring 
out the opposites, both in therapy and the patient's life, and to provide con­
ditions for syntheses. The key idea guiding the therapist's behavior is that 
for any point, an opposite or complementary position can be held. 
Thus, change may be facilitated by emphasizing acceptance, and accep­
tance by emphasizing change. The emphasis upon opposites sometimes takes 
place over time —that is, over the whole of an interaaion, rather than simul­
taneously or in each part of an interaaion. The wisdom of this approach 
with borderline individuals was noted much earlier by Sherman (1961), who 
commented that "whichever side the therapist aligns himself with, the pa­
tient will usually feel impelled to leave" (p. 55). Conversely, a rigid adherence 
to either pole of a dialectic leads to increased tension between therapist and 
patient, and usually to increased polarization rather than to synthesis and 
growth. Thus, synthesis and growth require attention to balance. The ther­
apist must search for what is left out of both the therapist's and patient's cur­
rent behaviors and ways of ordering reality, and then must assist the patient 
(while being open himself or herself) to create new orderings that embrace 
and include what was previously excluded. 
Maintaining a dialeaical stance in the therapeutic interaaion has a num­
ber of essential characteristics. First, speed is often of the essence. The idea 
is to keep the patient sufficiently off balance that she cannot find a secure 
foothold to maintain her previous behavioral, emotional, and cognitive ri­
gidity. Quick and light footwork is important here. Second, the therapist must 
be awake, observing and sensing each movement of the patient. The idea is 
to "go with the flow," responding with just enough movement each time the 
patient moves. The therapist has to be as alert as if he or she and the patient 
really were balanced at opposite ends of a teeter-totter perched on a high wire 
over the Grand Canyon. Third, a dialeaical approach requires that the ther­
apist move with certainty, strength, and total commitment. When a position 
is taken, it must be taken whole-heartedly Half-hearted, tentative movements 
with borderiine patients will have half-hearted tentative effeas. Sheldon Kopp 
(1971) made a similar point when he described gifted and charismatic psy­
chotherapists as follows: 
the central quality. . . is that such a man [sic] trusts himself. It is not so much 
that he is responding in ways which are beyond other men [sic] (or lesser ther­
apists). Rather it seems that he is past worrying about how he is doing. No longer 
expeaing to be unafraid or certain or perfect, he gives himself over to being just 
as he is at the moment, (p. 7) 
--- Page 222 ---
Dialectical Treatment Strategies 203 
Dialectics in the context of the relationship can be compared to ball­
room dancing. The therapist must respond to and with the patient just where 
she is. The idea is to move the patient slightly off balance but with a hand 
firmly guiding her, so that eventually she can allow herself to relax and let 
the music move her. However, the patient is frequently like a dancer twirling 
out of control. The therapist has to move in quickly with a counterforce to 
stop the patient from moving off the dance floor "Dancing" with the patient 
often requires the therapist to move quickly from strategy to strategy, alter­
nating acceptance with change, control with letting go, confrontation with 
support, the carrot with the stick, a hard edge with softness, and so on in 
rapid succession. 
The return to the teeter-totter image, the objea is for the therapist and 
patient to move to the middle together so that both can move up a notch to 
a higher platform and teeter-totter. Although the natural tendency when one 
or the other moves back on the teeter-totter is to balance it by moving back 
oneself, if both continue to move backwards, both will fall off and the thera­
py will be derailed or destroyed. A typical dialectical tension in the treatment 
of a borderline patient is between the patient's "I can't stand it" or "I can't 
do it" and the therapist's "Yes, you can." Thus, as the patient moves back 
slightly, the task of the therapist is to move slightly to the middle, hoping 
that the patient will then also move toward the middle: "I can see that it is 
terribly difficult. Perhaps you can't do it alone, but I will help you. I believe 
in you." 
Such a strategy with a suicidal patient is risky, and from this risk comes 
the notion that DBT is like a game of "chicken" played by therapist and pa­
tient. For example, a patient at my clinic hated group skUls training and wanted 
to quit, but did not want to have to leave her individual therapist as well. 
Her individual therapist, however, said that she was not willing to break the 
original therapy agreement. The patient left the session and called her ther­
apist, saying she was at the bus station and was going to take a bus to a dis­
tant spot, get off, and kill herself. If her therapist went to the bus station 
to get the patient, or immediately changed the rules of therapy, it would have 
been the same as jumping to the patient's side of the teeter-totter. If the ther­
apist had called the patient a "manipulator" and refused to talk to her, it would 
have been the same as moving back on the teeter-totter to maintain balance. 
The problem with that strategy, however, was that the patient might move 
back again herself. Instead, the therapist moved slightly toward the middle 
by expressing faith in the patient, validating her suffering, and encouraging 
her to find it in herself to get off the bus (if she indeed got on it), come back, 
and work with the therapist to solve the problem. The therapist would be 
waiting and hoping that the patient would come back. 
In the example just presented, jumping over the patient to the other end 
of the teeter-totter would have been an instance of a paradoxical move. Used 
skUlfuUy, such moves will induce the patient to jump quickly to the other 
side to maintain the balance. The therapist may say something like this: "I

can see that life is just unbearable for you. You really can't take care of your­
self any more. Perhaps therapy is too difficult at this point in your life. Do 
you think I should just take over for you for the time being? Perhaps I should 
send the police or an aid car to get you. Maybe this is the wrong program 
for you? Should we explore taking a break?" Or, more irreverently, "Perhaps 
staying in bed for 6 months is a good idea." 
All DBT strategies are arranged to highlight their dialeaical charaaer 
As shown in Figure 7.1, strategies can be categorized as primarily emphasiz­
ing change or acceptance. Many treatment impasses result from the therapist's 
faUing to balance treatment strategies on one side (change or acceptance) with 
their polar counterparts. The categorization is artificial, since in many ways 
every strategy comprises both acceptance and change. Indeed, the best strate­
gies are those that clearly combine the two, as I found in dealing with one 
patient who was referred to me. At the time of her referral, her options were 
to get into treatment with me or to be committed involuntarily to a state hospi­
tal (yet again). The patient repeatedly engaged in parasuicidal behavior and 
had burned out almost all mental health resources in the Seattle area. Her 
behavior seemed out of control. Her inpatient physicians were trying to get 
her involuntarily committed; the nurses were trying to get her into a program 
with me. At our first appointment, I told her that she was the perfect kind 
of person for our program and I would accept her into therapy (an accep­
tance strategy), but only if she agreed to work on changing her suicidal be­
havior (a change strategy). She was free to choose therapy with me or not 
(letting go), but I was also free to choose whether to work with her or not 
(control). The aspects of change and acceptance are discussed in more detail 
later. 
TEACHING DIALECTICAL BEHAVIOR PATTERNS 
Throughout therapy, an emphasis is put on dialectical reasoning, both on 
the part of the therapist and as a style of thinking taught to patients. Dialec­
tical reasoning requires the individual to assume an active role, to let go of 
logical reasoning and intellectual analysis as the only route to truth, and to 
embrace experiential knowledge. Meanings are generated and new relation­
ships are found by opposing any term or proposition with its opposite or an 
alternative. The primary message to be communicated to the patient is that 
concerning every subjea, opposite statements are possible. The dialeaical 
therapist helps the patient achieve syntheses of oppositions, rather than focus­
ing on verifying either side of an oppositional argument. The therapist helps 
the patient move from "either-or" to "both-and." Thus, many statements 
should be closely foUowed by their inherent opposites with the therapist model­
ing for the patient the ambiguity and inconsistency that reside therein. The 
key here is not to invalidate the first idea or polarity by asserting the second. 
The position is "Yes, but also. . " rather than "Yes, but no, I was mistaken." 
A similar position is adopted with respect to action and emotional 
--- Page 224 ---
Dialectical Treatment Strategies 205 
responses. Two ideas are important here. The first is that the possibilities for 
personal and social change do not emerge from some point outside of or tran­
scendent to the system, but lie within the existing contradiaions of each specif­
ic social context (Sipe, 1986). The person and the environment both challenge 
and Hmit each other reciprocally. Change, both in the person and in her so­
cial context, involves refinements and transformations of current capacities 
in light of these challenges and limits (Mahoney, 1991). 
The second idea is that extremes and rigid behavior patterns are signals 
that a dialectic has not been achieved. Thus, a middle path, similar to that 
advocated in Buddhism, is advocated and modeled: "The important thing in 
foUowing the path to Enlightenment is to avoid being caught and entangled 
in any extreme, that is, always to follow the Middle Way" (Kyokai, 1966). 
This point holds for therapist and patient alike. Thus, the therapist should 
not hold to flexibility in a rigid fashion or avoid extremes at all costs. As 
Robert Aitken, a Zen master, has said, we must even "be detached from our 
non-attachment" (Aitken, 1987 p. 40). 
Dialectics, from the point of view of behavior, can be most clearly seen 
in the treatment targets advocated in DBT. The DBT behavioral skills are good 
examples here. Emotion regulation is balanced with mindfulness, where the 
emphasis is on observing, describing, and participating, instead of regulat­
ing emotional or any other experience. Even in the teaching of emotional con­
trol, both distraction and control of attention on the one hand, and 
experiencing with attention and letting go of control on the other, are advo­
cated. Interpersonal effeaiveness focuses on changing problematic situations; 
by contrast, distress tolerance emphasizes accepting problematic situations. 
SPECIFIC DIALECTICAL STRATEGIES 
Specific techniques that target the therapist-patient relationship and dialec­
tical behavior patterns are described below and summarized in the bottom 
half of Table 7.1. Although I believe that each of these strategies can be 
described in strictly behavioral terms, I have not attempted to translate from 
dialectical discourse to behavioral terms in every instance. It would, it seems, 
violate the spirit of the dialectics I am trying to convey. 
I. ENTERING THE PARADOX 
Allen Frances (1988) once said that one of the first and most important tasks 
in psychotherapy with borderline patients is to get their attention. "Entering 
the paradox" is a powerful way to do just that. It works, in part, because 
paradox contains within itself surprise; like humor, it presents the unex­
pected. When confronted with a paradox, one has to sit up and take notice. 
Entering the paradox is a strategy much like koan practice for the Zen stu­
dent. Koans are dilemmas or enigmatic stories that Zen students are given 
to solve, even though there seem to be no logical answers; they force students to

go beyond intellectual understanding to direa experiential knowledge. Know­
ing how sugar tastes by reading about its taste qualities in a book is very differ­
ent from knowing how sugar tastes by directly experiencing sugar on one's 
tongue. The solution to a koan is not logical or intellectual. It is an experience. 
In this therapeutic strategy, the therapist highlights for the patient the 
paradoxical contradictions of the patient's own behavior, of the therapeutic 
process, and of reality in general. The patient's attempts at rational explana­
tions of a paradox meet silence, another question from the therapist, or a 
story or slightiy different paradox that may throw some (but not too much) 
light on the enigma to be solved. Suler (1989) suggests that a koan "becomes 
a desperate struggle around personal issues, including the personal conflicts 
--- Page 226 ---
Dialectical Treatment Strategies 207 
that led the student to Zen. It is a struggle for one's very Hfe" (p. 223). So, 
too, a therapeutic paradox well constructed and highHghted becomes for the 
borderline patient a struggle for life. Innumerable paradoxical dilemmas that 
take on life-and-death qualities typically arise in therapy with a borderline 
patient. For example, the therapist may say, "If I didn't care for you, 1 would 
try to save you." The patient says, "How can you say you care for me if you 
won't save me when I am so desperate?" The ultimate synthesis here is "You 
are already saved." However, interim insights have to do with the fact that, 
in reality, the therapist can not save the patient. Trying to do so, therefore, 
would divert therapy into pseudo-help rather than the real help that the pa­
tient needs. Also, even if the therapist could save the patient in the current 
moment, it takes infinitely more care and patience for the therapist to help 
the patient save herself than for the therapist to rescue the patient. 
Another example has to do with the typical borderline patient's peren­
nial dilemma of deciding who is right and who is wrong whenever a disagree­
ment or confrontation arises. The idea that the answer is both (or neither) 
is difficult for the patient to grasp. Often, the therapeutic relationship is the 
first one the patient has ever been in where, during a confrontation, the other 
person asserts that "I'm OK and you're OK." In particular— and this is a cru­
cial point—the therapist in DBT often validates the patient's point, but simul­
taneously does not "give in" or change his or her behavior. For example, in 
the strategy of observing limits (see Chapter 10), the therapist validates the 
patient's need ("Yes, it would be better for you if I were not going out of town 
this weekend") while meanwhile continuing with plans to go out of town. 
The patient is portrayed as the "good guy" ("You really do need what you 
say you do"), but so is therapist ("And I'm still OK for not giving it to you 
and going out of town"). 
The essence of the strategy of entering the paradox, however, is the ther­
apist's refusal to step in with logic or intellectual explanation to pull the pa­
tient out of the stmggle. As Suler (1989) goes on to state, "The cracking open 
of the double-binding self-contradiaion and the insightful reframing of one's 
crisis can only occur if, in the words of Zen, one 'lets go of the hold'. . . let­
ting things happen of their own accord" (p. 223). Some paradoxes inherent 
in psychotherapy and in the Hfe of a borderline patient may take years to 
resolve. 
By entering the paradox, the therapist continually stresses to the patient 
that things can both be true and not true, that an answer can be both yes 
and no. The therapist is not drawn into the patient's wish to assert one side 
of an oppositional argument as absolutely true, to the exclusion of the truth 
of the oppositional point of view. Neither does the therapist unconditionally 
assert the other side of the argument. The therapist continues to maintain 
that both sides can be true and that an answer to any question can be both 
yes and no. As noted earlier, "both-and" is offered as an alternative to 
"either-or." The therapist need not be overly concerned about clearing up the 
patient's confusion about this; the confusion will clear up as the patient be­
comes more comfortable with the dialeaical approach. To retum to the teeter-
--- Page 227 ---
208 BASIC TREATMENT STRATEGIES 
totter metaphor, when the patient sits on the very end of one side of the teeter-
totter, the therapist both sits at the other end to provide balance and simul­
taneously focuses attention on the oneness of the teeter-totter 
A central paradox of DBT and all therapies is that all behavior is "good," 
yet the patient is in therapy to change "bad" behavior DBT stresses valida­
tion of a patient's responses, but only to counter the invalidation she has been 
exposed to. Validation is a strategic necessity. As long as the patient (or the 
therapist) is mired in invalidation or in validation, she cannot see that the 
dichotomy itself is an artificial one. Behavior is neither valid nor invalid, neither 
good nor bad. Once the balance is achieved, both therapist and patient must 
move to a position of neither validation nor invalidation. Responses simply 
are. They arise as a consequence of causes and conditions that are both past 
and immediate, and that are both intemal and external to the person. In turn, 
responses have consequences, which may either be desired or not. 
The paradox of change versus acceptance runs throughout therapy. En­
tering the paradox, the therapist highlights and amplifies the seeming incon-
gmity that even the inability to accept must be accepted. (As we say to patients, 
"Don't judge judging.") A patient is exhorted to accept herself just as she is 
in the moment. But, of course, if she does that, she will have changed sub­
stantially; indeed, the very admonition to learn to accept conveys a nonac­
ceptance of the status quo. The patient is told that she is perfea just as she 
is, neither good nor bad, and completely understandable, yet she must change 
her behavior patterns. In this way, the therapist heightens the naturally aris­
ing dialectical tensions facing the patient, so that she has no way out other 
than to move away from the extremes. Patrick Hawk, a master of Zen and 
Christian contemplation, suggests that "Koans are themes to be clarified in 
engagement with one's teacher. . .This act of making clear is called realiza­
tion" (personal communication, 1992). In DBT, as in Zen, clarification and 
realization are arrived at via the engagement of the student/patient with the 
teacher/therapist. In particular, the therapist must enter the multiple paradoxes 
the patient encounters in trying to solve the dialectical dilemmas of extreme 
vulnerability versus invalidating the vulnerability; unrelenting crises versus 
blocking and inhibiting the experience of the emotional components of the 
crises; and a passive inabUity to resolve problems and painful emotional states 
versus apparent independence, invulnerability, and competence. 
A number of dialectical tensions arise naturaUy in the course of the psy­
chotherapy relationship. The patient is free to choose her own behavior, but 
she can not stay in therapy if she does not choose to reduce suicidal behaviors. 
The patient is taught to achieve greater self-efficacy by becoming better at 
asking for and receiving help from others. The patient has a right to kill her­
self, but if she ever convinces the therapist that suicide is imminent, she may 
be locked up. The therapist is paid to care for the patient, but the patient's 
doubts about the genuineness of the therapist's caring are usually interpreted 
as instances of the patient's problems showing up in the therapeutic relation­
ship. And if the patient stops paying, the therapy stops. The therapist is both 
--- Page 228 ---

detached and intimate, modeling autonomy and independence, yet encourag­
ing attachment and dependence on the part of the patient. The patient is not 
responsible for being the way she is, but she is responsible for what she 
becomes. 
The patient is urged to get in control of excessive attempts to control. 
The therapist uses highly controlling techniques to increase the patient's free­
dom. Struggling with, confronting, and breaking through these paradoxes 
forces the patient to let go of rigid pattems of thought, emotion, and behavior 
so that more spontaneous and flexible pattems may emerge. Likewise, genuine 
entering of the paradox, within both the therapeutic relationship and the con­
sultation group, forces the therapist to let go of rigid theoretical positions 
and inflexible therapy rules, regulations, and patterns of action. 
2. THE USE OF METAPHOR 
The use of metaphor and storytelling has been stressed by many psychother­
apists, most notably by Milton Erickson, who was famous for his teaching 
stories (Rosen, 1982). Likewise, the use of metaphor, in the form of simple 
analogies, anecdotes, parables, myths, or stories, is extremely important in 
DBT. Metaphors are alternative means of teaching dialectical thinking and 
opening up possibilities of new behaviors. They encourage both patient and 
therapist to look for and create alternate meanings and points of reference 
for events under scrutiny. Ones from which multiple meanings can be drawn 
are usually the most effective in encouraging different views of reality. 
As many other writers have discussed (Barker, 1985; Deikman, 1982; 
Kopp, 1971), the use of metaphor is a valuable strategy in psychotherapy for 
a number of reasons. Stories are usually more interesting and easier to remem­
ber than straight lecturing or instruction. Thus, a person whose attention 
wanders when she is presented with behavioral information or instruaion, 
may find it much easier to attend to a story. Stories also allow an individual 
to use them in her own way, for her own purposes. Thus, the sense of being 
controlled by the therapist or teacher is lessened, and the patient may be more 
relaxed and open to a new way of thinking or behaving; she is thus less likely 
to stop listening immediately or to feel overwhelmed. She can take from the 
story what she can use, either immediately or at a later point. FinaUy, 
metaphors, when constmaed properly, can be less threatening to the individu­
al. Points can be made indirectly, in a way that softens their impact. 
The use of stories can be especially helpful when the therapist is trying 
to communicate the harmful effeas of the patient's behavior on others in a 
way that normalizes the responses of others while not directly criticizing the 
patient. They can also be useful in talking about the therapist's own responses 
(especially when the therapist's own motivation to continue working is flag­
ging), or in telling the patient what she can expea from the therapist. 
Metaphors can also redefine, reframe, and suggest solutions to problems; help 
the patient recognize aspects of her own behavior in or reactions to situa-
--- Page 229 ---

tions; and give the patient hope (Barker, 1985). Generally, the idea is to take 
something the patient understands, such as two people climbing a mountain, 
and compare it by way of analogy to something the patient does not under­
stand, such as the therapeutic process. 
Over the years, my colleagues and I have developed a large number of 
metaphors to discuss suicidal and therapy-interfering behaviors, acceptance, 
willingness, therapy, and life in general. Therapy-interfering behaviors have 
been compared to a mountain climber's refusing to wear winter gear when 
climbing in the snow, hiding the climbing gear, or sitting on a rock looking 
at the scenery when a storm is threatening; to a mule's climbing out of the 
Grand Canyon and refusing to go forward or backward (not an analogy that 
gained me a lot of points with the patient!); and to one cook's throwing cups 
of salt instead of sugar into cherry pies while the other cook is out of the 
room. Passive behavior and emotional avoidance (and, by contrast what the 
patient has to do) have been compared to cringing in the corner of a room 
on fire when the only way out is through the flaming door (the person has 
to wrap herself in wet sheets and run through the door) and to clinging to 
an icy mountain ledge when the only way to safety is to keep going (the per­
son has to move slowly across the ledge without looking down). Suicidal be­
haviors have been compared to a climber's jumping off the mountain, 
sometimes with the rope stUl tied to the guide (who then has to puU the climber 
up) and sometimes after cutting the rope; to demanding a divorce from an 
unwilling partner; and to addiaive behaviors such as drinking and drugs. 
Leaming distress tolerance is like leaming to be a blanket spread on the ground 
on a fall day, letting leaves fall as they may without fighting them off. Learn­
ing acceptance is like a gardener's learning to love the dandelions that come 
into the garden year after year, no matter what the gardener does to get rid 
of them. Trying to be what others want the patient to be is like a tulip's try­
ing to be a rose just because it happens to have been planted in a rose garden. 
Life led willingly is like playing a game of cards (the object is to play each 
hand as well as possible, not to control what cards are dealt), or like hitting 
baseballs or tennis balls thrown by a ball-throwing machine (the person can't 
stop or even slow down the balls coming, so she just swings as well as she 
can and then focuses on the next ball). 
We have used more extended metaphors to describe therapy and the 
process of growth and change. Here is one: Therapy, for the patient, is like 
climbing out of hell on a red-hot aluminium ladder with no gloves or shoes. 
Continually jumping off or letting go is therapy-interfering behavior by the 
patient. Holding a blowtorch on the patient's feet to get her to climb faster 
is therapy-interfering behavior by the therapist. The problem here is that the 
bottom of hell is usuaUy hotter even than the ladder, so that after a while 
the patient always gets up, gets back on the ladder, and has to climb again. 
Another extended metaphor for therapy is learning how to swim in aU kinds 
of conditions. The patient is the swimmer; the therapist is the coach, sitting 
in a rowboat circling the patient, providing direaions and encouragement. 
--- Page 230 ---
Dialectical Treatment Strategies 211 
The tension often is between the swimmer's wanting to get in the boat so 
the coach can row her to shore and the coach's wanting the swimmer to stay 
in the water If the coach rows the swimmer to the shore, she will never learn 
to swim, but if the swimmer drowns in rough seas she won't leam to swim 
either Clinging to the boat and refusing to swim, and swimming under water 
to scare the coach into jumping in after her, are instances of patient therapy-
interfering behaviors. Refusing to hold out an oar when the swimmer keeps 
going under, and rowing the swimmer to shore every time a black cloud comes 
by, are examples of therapist therapy-interfering behaviors. 
Patients often feel misunderstood whenever their therapists push them 
to make changes to improve their lives. "If you understood me, you wouldn't 
ask me to do something I can't do," or, put another way, "If you took my 
suffering seriously, you wouldn't ask me to do something that makes me feel 
worse than I already do," is a common message sent from borderline patient 
to therapist. This message and the problems it creates for the therapist are 
so common in the treatment of BPD that Lorna Benjamin (in press) has 
described BPD interpersonal pattems as playing out a scenario of "My mis­
ery is your command." In this situation, stories can be particularly useful to 
validate both the patient's emotional pain and sense of helplessness, and the 
therapist's attempt to get the patient moving. My favorite story is an elabora­
tion of one I have described elsewhere in this book. A woman with no shoes 
is standing on a white-hot bed of burning coals. The bed is very deep and 
very wide. The woman is paralyzed with pain and calls out to her friend to 
run and get a pitcher of cooling water to pour on her feet. But there is not 
enough water to cool down all the coals. So the friend, very anxious for the 
woman to get out of her suffering as quickly as possible, yells "Run!" And 
if that does not work, the friend jumps into the coals and starts pushing the 
patient toward the cool grasses by the side. Does the friend understand the 
woman's pain? If she really understood it, would she have poured on the cool 
water instead? 
A simUar story and question can be fashioned around the metaphor of 
the room on fire, mentioned briefly above. The woman is so afraid of the 
fire that she wants to remain pressed into the corner of the back room. Does 
the friend who truly understands her pain stay back there with her, perishing 
with her in the fire? Or does the good friend grab her despite her protests 
and puU both to safety through the flaming door? In a slight variation, I asked 
the patient to imagine that she and I were alone on a raft in the middle of 
the ocean following a shipwreck several days earlier Her arm was badly cut 
and she was in desperate pain. Over and over she was asking me for pain 
medicine, or for anything to take away the pain. I asked her to imagine fur­
ther that the first aid kit was washed out to sea. If I didn't find and give her 
pain medicine, would that mean that I did not understand or take seriously 
her pain? What if I only had three more pain capsules and I said, "Let's ra­
tion them and take only one a day so we won't run out so quickly?" Or would 
the patient believe that I reaUy had lots of pain capsules and just didn't want 
--- Page 231 ---
212 BASIC TREATMENT STRATEGIES 
her to have any—perhaps because I thought she was a dmg addia? Honest dis­
cussion of such story variations can often clarify difficult therapeutic impasses. 
These analogies, or any other that the therapist thinks of, can be spun 
into shorter or longer stories as the situation calls for (and as I have demon­
strated). In some cases, I have spent almost entire sessions whoUy within a 
metaphorical story spun alternately by myself and the patient. Teaching stories 
and metaphors have been used in all spiritual traditions (Vedanta, Buddhism, 
Zen, Hasidic, Christian, and Sufi), as well as in phUosophy, literature, and 
children's stories. (See Appendix for other sources.) 
3. THE DEVIL'S ADVOCATE TECHNIQUE 
In the "devil's advocate" strategy, developed by Marvin Goldfried (Goldfried, 
Linehan, & Smith, 1978), the therapist presents an extreme propositional 
statement, asks the patient whether she believes the statement, and then plays 
the role of devil's advocate to counter attempts by the patient to disprove the 
proposition. The therapist presents the thesis and elicits the antithesis from 
the patient; in the process of argument, they arrive at a synthesis. The ex­
treme proposition presented by the therapist should relate to dysfunaional 
beliefs that the patient has expressed or to problematic propositional rules 
that the patient seems to be following. It is used best to counteraa new, op­
positional patterns. The technique is similar to the use of paradox, in which 
the therapist holds down the maladaptive end of the continuum and thereby 
forces the patient to the adaptive end. 
The devil's advocate technique is always used in the first several sessions 
to elicit a strong commitment to change on the part of the patient. The ther­
apist argues against change and commitment to therapy, because change is 
painful and difficult; ideally, this moves the patient to take the oppositional 
position in favor of change and commitment. This use of the strategy is dis­
cussed further in Chapter 9. 
The argumentative approach often used in cognitive restructuring thera­
py is another example of the devU's advocate strategy. For example, the thesis 
may be an irrational beHef of the type proposed by EUis (1962), such as "Every­
one has to love me, and if there is one person who doesn't, then I am a worth­
less person," or "If I offend anyone for any reason, it is a mortal catastrophe." 
The therapist argues in favor of the irrational belief, questioning why the pa­
tient does not agree. For example, the therapist may present the second propo­
sition given above by suggesting that even if a total stranger is offended at 
some legitimate activity of the patient's (such as driving the speed limit on 
the highway), or if someone is offended because of a distortion, or if some­
one is offended by the patient's refusal to behave Ulegally or immorally (such 
as cheating), the patient should alter her behavior to conform to what is ex­
pected and approved of. Anything the patient proposes can be countered by 
exaggerating her usual position until the self-defeating nature of the belief 
becomes apparent. 
--- Page 232 ---
Dialectical Treatment Strategies 213 
A number of things are necessary to carry this technique off. First, the 
therapist must be alert to the patient's actual dysfunaional rules and gener­
alized beliefs. Second, the therapist has to engage the patient with a straight 
face and with a rather naive-seeming expressive style. Third, a kind of off­
beat but very logical response to each of the patient's argument is helpful. 
Fourth, the therapist's position has to be reasonable enough to seem "real," 
but extreme enough to allow counterai^ment by the patient. A position that 
simultaneously validates the patient's attachment to an idea and invalidates 
the wisdom of the idea is the ideal. A certain lightness and abUity to modify 
an argument unobtrusively are also necessary. Finally, the therapist has to 
know when to stay deadly serious and when to "lighten up" and play the ar­
gument for tongue-in-cheek humor 
4. EXTENDING 
"Extending" is the therapist's taking the patient more seriously than she takes 
herself. Whereas the patient may have been saying something for effect, or 
expressing an extreme emotion in order to induce reasonably minor changes 
in the environment, the therapist takes the communication literally. This strate­
gy is the emotional equivalent of the devil's advocate strategy. 
For example, the patient may make an extreme statement about the ef­
feas or consequences of some event or problem in her life ("If you don't sched­
ule an extra session with me, I wUl kill myself). The therapist first takes the 
patient's statement of the effeas or consequences literally, and then responds 
to the seriousness of the consequences ("I will kill myself), independently 
of their relationship to the event or problem identified by the patient (not 
scheduling an extra therapy session). The therapist may say, "We've got to 
do something immediately if you are so distressed that you might kill your­
self. What about hospitalization? Maybe that is needed. How can we discuss 
such a mundane topic as session scheduling when your life is in danger? Sur­
ely, this threat to your life must be dealt with first. How are you planning 
to kiU yourself?" The aspect of the communication that the therapist takes 
seriously is not the aspect that the patient wants taken seriously. The patient 
wants the problem taken seriously, and indeed is often extending its serious­
ness. The therapist takes the dire consequences seriously and extends them 
even further by refusing to stop focusing on them until they are resolved. 
Used weU, this strategy has the effea of making the patient see that she 
is exaggerating the consequences. When this happens ("OK, maybe I am ex­
aggerating. I'm not feeling that suicidal"), it is cmcial that the therapist then 
move to taking the problem very seriously. The patient must be reinforced 
for reducing the emotional consequences of the problem. Used poorly, the 
strategy can be a cover for a therapist's faUing to take legitimate problems 
of the patient seriously. This technique is best used when the patient is not 
expeaing the therapist to take her seriously, or when escalating a crisis or 
set of emotional consequences is maintained by its instrumental effect on the 
--- Page 233 ---
214 BASIC TREATMENT STRATEGIES 
environment. It can be particularly effective when the therapist feels manipu­
lated. It has the advantage that it manages both the patient's behavior and, 
at times, the therapist's affect and desire to attack, in one response. Done 
successfully, it is very satisfying. 
The term "extending" to describe this technique has been borrowed from 
aikido, a Japanese art of self-defense. Extending is an aikido practitioner's 
aUowing the movements of a challenger to reach their natural completion, 
and then extending the end point of the movement slightly further than it 
would go naturally; this leaves the challenger off balance and vulnerable to 
a shift in direction. Extending is always preceded by "blending," which in ai­
kido means accepting or joining or moving with the challenger's energy flow 
in the direction in which it is going (Saposnek, 1980). For example, the pa­
tient may say to the therapist, "If you don't act different, this therapy isn't 
going to help me" [the challenge]. The therapist says, "If therapy isn't help­
ing you [blending], we need to do something about that [going to the natural 
conclusion of the response]. Do you think you should fire me? Perhaps we 
should get you a new therapist? This is very serious [extending]." Each of 
the charaaeristics noted above in regard to the devU's advocate technique (pick­
ing up overly extreme consequences, naivete, an offbeat but very logical 
response, a response reasonable enough to seem "real" but extreme enough 
to allow the patient to see that she is being extreme, lightness, and unobtru­
sive modification of the therapist's position) is equally important here. 
5. ACTIVATING "WISE MIND" 
In DBT, patients are presented with the concept of three primary states of 
mind: "reasonable mind," "emotion mind," and "wise mind." A person is in 
"reasonable mind" when she is approaching knowledge intellectually, is think­
ing rationally and logicaUy, attends to empirical faas, is planful in her be­
havior, focuses her attention, and is "cool" in her approach to problems. The 
person is in "emotion mind" when thinking and behavior are controlled 
primarily by her current emotional state. In "emotion mind," cognitions are 
"hot"; reasonable, logical thinking is difficult; facts are amplified or distort­
ed to be congruent with current affect; and the energy of behavior is likewise 
congruent with the current emotional state. 
"Wise mind" is the integration of "emotion mind" and "reasonable mind"; 
it also goes beyond them. "Wise mind" adds intuitive knowing to emotional 
experiencing and logical analysis. There are many definitions of intuition. 
Deikman (1982) suggests that it is knowing that is not mediated by reason 
and goes beyond what is received via the senses. It has qualities of direct ex­
perience, immediate cognition, and the grasping of the meaning, significance, 
or truth of an event without relying on intellectual analysis. Intuitive know­
ing is guided by "feelings of deepening coherence" (Polanyi, 1958). Although 
experience and reason play a part, the quality of the intuitive experience is 
unique. "Wise mind" depends upon a full cooperation of all ways of know-
--- Page 234 ---
Dialectical Treatment Strategies 215 
ing: observation, logical analysis, kinetic and sensory experience, behavioral 
leaming, and intuition (May, 1982). 
Borderline patients have to learn how to access "wise mind." In effect, 
they have to let go of emotional processing and logical analyses, of set ideas 
and extreme reactions; they must become calm enough to allow wise know­
ing to proceed uncomplicated and unintruded upon by other, more volition­
al ("reasonable mind") or overdetermined ("emotion mind") modes of 
knowing. The first task for some patients (though certainly not all) is to con­
vince them that they are indeed capable of this. A borderline patient may 
question the very idea that she has an ability to achieve wisdom of any sort. 
First, the therapist simply has to insist that all humans have "wise mind," much 
as aU humans have hearts. The faa that a patient cannot see her heart doesn't 
mean she doesn't have one. Second, it is often helpful to give a number of 
examples of times when the patient may have experienced "wise mind." Many 
people experience it immediately following a crisis or enormous chaos in their 
lives. It is the calm that follows the storm. It is that experience of suddenly 
getting to the heart of a matter, seeing or knowing something direaly and 
clearly. Sometimes it may be experienced as grasping the whole piaure in­
stead of only parts; at other times it may be the experience of "feeling" the 
right choice in a dilemma, when the feeling comes from deep within rather 
than from a current emotional state. Third, it can be useful to lead the per­
son through exercises in which she may be able to experience that inner calm­
ness that surrounds "wise mind." GeneraUy, I have patients foUow their breath 
(attend to their breath coming in and out), and after some time try to let their 
attentional focus settle into their physical center, at the bottom of their inha­
lation. That very centered point is "wise mind." Almost all patients are able 
to sense this point. 
When asked to go into "wise mind" later, a patient is instruaed to take 
this stance and then to respond from that center of calmness. It can be com­
pared to going deep within a well in the ground. The water at the bottom 
of the well —and, indeed, the entire underground ocean —is "wise mind." But 
on the way down there are often trap doors that impede progress. Sometimes 
the doors are so cleverly buUt that the person actually believes that there is 
no water at the bottom of the well. A trap door may look like the bottom 
of the well. The task of the therapist is to help the patient figure out how 
to get each trap door open. Perhaps it is locked and she needs a key. Perhaps 
it is nailed shut and she needs a hammer, or it is glued shut and she needs 
a chisel. But, with persistence and diligence, the ocean of wisdom at the bot­
tom can be reached. 
Borderline patients may have difficulty distinguishing "wise mind" from 
"emotion mind." Both have a quality of "feeling" something to be the case; 
both rely on a type of knowing that is different from reasoning or analysis. 
To go back to our story, if there has been a hard rain, water can coUea on 
top of a trap door in the well. If the trap door stays shut, the pool of water 
can be confused with the ocean at the bottom of the well. It can be easy for 
--- Page 235 ---
216 BASIC TREATMENT STRATEGIES 
both therapist and patient to get confused. Rain water can look like ocean 
water The intensity of emotions can generate experiences of certainty that 
mimic the stable, calm certainty of wisdom. There is no simple solution to 
this. If intense emotion is obvious, the suspicion that a conclusion is based 
on "emotion mind" instead of "wise mind" is probably correct. GeneraUy, 
time is the best ally here. 
A borderline patient often makes statements that represent her emotion­
al or feeling state ("I feel fat or unlovable," "I don't want to live without him," 
"I'm afraid I'm going to fail") as if the feeling state provides information about 
the empirical reality ("I am fat or unlovable," "I can't live without him," "I'm 
going to fail"). When this occurs, it is effective at times simply to question 
the patient in this manner: "I'm not interested in how you feel. I'm not in­
terested in what you believe or think. I am interested in what you know to 
be true (in your 'wise mind'). What do you know to be true? What is true?" 
The dialectical tension here is between what the patient feels to be true and 
what she thinks to be true; the synthesis is what she knows to be true. The 
refusal of the therapist to entertain "emotion mind" or "reasonable mind" 
is an example of a controlling strategy in the service of letting go. 
The push toward "wise mind" by the therapist can be easily abused; es­
pecially when the therapist confuses "wise mind" with what the therapist be­
lieves to be the case: "If I agree with you, then you are functioning from 'wise 
mind.' " This can be particularly difficult when the therapist trusts the wis­
dom of his or her own knowledge or opinions. How can one person's "wise 
mind" conflict with another's? This is an interesting paradox. The value of 
therapeutic humility cannot be overstated. In DBT, one of the major func­
tions of the consultation/supervision group is to provide a balance to the ar­
rogance that can easily accompany such a powerful position as the therapist's. 
6. MAKING LEMONADE OUT OF LEMONS 
"Making lemonade out of lemons" requires that the therapist take something 
that seems apparently problematic and turn it into an asset. The idea is simi­
lar to the notion in psychodynamic therapy of utUizing the patient's resistances: 
The worse the patient acts in therapy, the better it is. If problems did not 
show up in the therapeutic encounter, how could the therapist be helpful? 
Problems in everyday life are opportunities to practice skUls. Indeed, from 
the point of view of practicing skills, not having problems would be a dis­
aster, since there would be nothing to practice on. Suffering, when accepted, 
enhances empathy, and those who have suffered can reach out and help others. 
A variation here is the notion that the patient's greatest weaknesses are or­
dinarily also her greatest strengths (e.g., her persistence in "resisting" change 
is just what will keep her going until changes are made). 
The idea that lemons can be made into lemonade should not be con­
fused with the invalidating refrain, repeatedly heard by borderiine patients, 
that the lemons in their lives are actually already lemonade if only they could 
--- Page 236 ---
Dialectical Treatment Strategies 217 
realize it. One of the dangers of this strategy is that a patient may feel that 
the therapist is not taking her problems seriously. The trick is not to over­
simplify how hard it can be to find such positive characteristics; in fact, it 
can be like looking for a needle in a hay stack. Thus, the strategy cannot 
be used in a cavalier manner Its effeaiveness rests on a therapeutic relation­
ship where the patient knows that the therapist has deep compassion for her 
suffering. In that context, however, the strategy can be used lightiy and with 
humor When I conduct skills training, for instance, patients soon realize that 
I may rejoice over even the worst crisis as an opportunity to praaice or learn 
a skill. The incongruity of my response ("Oh, how wonderful!") to a patient's 
distress ("I got fired") forces the patient to stop and take in new information 
(i.e., this is a chance to practice interpersonal effectiveness, emotion regula­
tion, or distress tolerance skills, depending on the current skill module). The 
skill of the therapist is in finding the silver lining without denying that the 
cloud is indeed black. 
7. ALLOWING NATURAL CHANGE 
Dialeaics assumes that the nature of reality is process, development, and 
change. Thus, to introduce arbitrary stability and consistency into therapy 
would be nondialectical in character. In contrast to many other therapeutic 
approaches, DBT does not avoid introducing change and instability into ther­
apy, nor is emphasis put on maintaining a consistent therapeutic environment. 
Arrangement of the physical setting may change from time to time; appoint­
ment times may vary; rules may be changed; and different therapists inter­
aaing with the patient may aU say different things. The change, development, 
and inconsistency inherent in any environment are allowed to proceed natur­
ally. The key words here are "allowed" and "naturally." AUowing change is 
not the same thing as introducing change for the sake of change; that would 
be arbitrary change. Natural changes are those that evolve from current con­
ditions rather than those that are imposed from without. 
Stability and consistency are more comfortable for borderline patients, 
and many have enormous difficulty with change. The notion here is that ex­
posure to change, in a safe atmosphere, can be therapeutic. Avoidance of 
change within the therapeutic relationship offers littie opportunity for the 
patient to develop comfort with change, ambiguity, unpredictability, and in­
consistency. (Indeed, the opportunity to learn to cope effeaively with change 
is the "lemonade" made from the "lemon" of experiencing the occasional in­
consistency of the therapist's behavior) An artificial stability and predicta-
bUity within the therapeutic relationship also limit the generalizability of 
learning within that relationship to more natural relationships, where am­
biguity and a certain amount of unprediaability often prevail. 
Does this strategy mean that there is no consistency in DBT? No. But 
the consistencies that do exist are like the still water underneath the waves 
that come and go in the ocean. They are more real than apparent. Technical-
--- Page 237 ---
218 BASIC TREATMENT STRATEGIES 
ly, the only consistency required is that behavioral progress be reinforced and 
the dysfunctional status quo as well as backsliding not be reinforced. Thus, 
the therapist must be consistently on the side of the patient, wiUing to bend 
the therapy to promote the welfare of the patient. Indeed, it is this consisten­
cy of care that makes the relationship safe enough for exposure to change 
to be beneficial. 
8. DIALECTICAL ASSESSMENT 
Much of what goes on in any psychotherapy can be thought of as "assess­
ment." That is, the therapist and the patient try to figure out just exaaly what 
is influencing what; what factors are causing the person to act, feel, and think 
as she does; what is going wrong or right in the patient's life and in therapy; 
and what is going on at this very moment. Where the therapist direas the 
patient to look for answers depends on the theoretical persuasion of the ther­
apist. American psychology and psychiatry in general, and most theoretical 
approaches to BPD in particular, have a penchant for locating the source of 
disorder within the individual rather than within the social and physical con­
text surrounding the person. Although psychological theories typically ascribe 
primary importance to early environmental events in the development of the 
problems of the borderline patient, most theories pay scant attention to the 
role of the current environment in eliciting and maintaining the individual's 
problems. Disordered biology, dysfunctional cognitive schemas, inadequate 
objea relations, and skill deficits, however, all receive extensive attention. Bor­
derline individuals are notable for their acceptance of the premise that their 
problems are the results of personal deficiencies or disorders. Indeed, many 
see themselves as fatally flawed, forever unable to change. 
Remember, however, that a dialectical world view is a wholistic, systems 
view. Patterns of influence are reciprocal and developmental. Identity is rela­
tional. Dialectical assessment requires that the therapist, along with the pa­
tient, constantly look for what is missing from individual or personal 
explanations of current behaviors and events. The question always being asked 
is "What is being left out here?" The assessment does not stop at the immedi­
ate environment, or at the historical family or other past learning experiences 
(although these are not ignored); it also examines social, political, and eco­
nomic influences on the patient's current behavior Robert Sipe (1986, pp. 
74-75), quoting Trent Schroyer (1972, pp. 30-31), describes a simUar point: 
Dialectical awareness. . . [is that] which "restores missing parts to historical self-
formulation, true actuality to false appearance" so that we can "see through so­
cially unnecessary authority and control systems." In seeing our psychological 
and social world as it really is, we can see real possibilities for its transforma­
tion. ... As missing parts are restored, new insights into the potential for psy­
chosocial change emerge that previously could not be comprehended. 
In work with women in particular, dialectical assessment directs attention 
to the role of culturally institutionalized sexism and sex-role expectations in

individuals' problems. Indeed, the frequent double binds that sex-role, social 
class, religious, regional, and racial expeaations place on individual behavior 
are viewed dialeaically as important influences on individual behavior, in­
cluding the behaviors that borderline individuals find problematic. The pos­
sibility that BPD is a joint person-environment disorder is entertained. 
Borderline patients often say that they feel as if they don't "fit in"; they 
feel alienated or disconnected from the culture they are living in. Their be­
havior certainly suggests that they have great difficulty adapting or adjusting 
to the social world they must live in. The traditional solution to this is to 
figure out how such an individual can change herself to fit in better or to 
better accept her fate. The social context that the person finds herself in, 
however, is often presented as natural ("the way things are") and unchange­
able. The notion that there might be a fatal flaw in the social fabric—in the 
human and social relationships of the society in which the person finds 
herself—is frequently not considered. The illusion is so pervasive that the in­
dividual has little choice but to believe that she is indeed inadequate or fatal­
ly flawed. Dialectical assessment requires an analysis of the larger social 
network and its interrelationship with the more narrow personal context. The 
shoe is put on the other foot, so to speak, and changes the person can make 
in the environment are explored. Dialectical assessment is aimed at introduc­
ing the idea that another culture—a culture into which the borderline individu­
al can fit—is possible. 
These very same points also apply to analyzing the influence of the struc­
ture of therapy on the weU-being of the borderline patient. Over the years, 
rules and regulations about how psychotherapy should progress have been 
developed. It seems at times that these rules and regulations are also natural, 
the only way things can be. Such a position leads to a certain rigidity of ther­
apeutic behaviors. The implication once again is that if a patient does not 
improve, there is something wrong with her rather than with the therapy. The 
patient is taught to fit the therapy; we do not ordinarily think of fitting the 
therapy to the patient. Dialeaical assessment requires an openness to examin­
ing the oppressive or iatrogenic nature of some therapeutic rules and styles 
when working with borderline patients. Such an analysis will expand the pos­
sibiHties of therapy, and perhaps aUow a development of the therapeutic proce­
dures and relationship for the maximum benefit of both patient and therapist. 
Concluding Comments 
The dialectical strategies proposed here can easily be confused with gimmicks 
or with playing of a game (albeit a quite sophisticated game). And without 
care, honesty, and commitment to what is aaually said and done, this would 
be the case. A dialeaical stance requires the therapist to hold both sides of 
every polarity, to believe that he or she does not have absolute truth, and 
to search in earnest for what is missing in both the therapist's and the pa­
tient's way of construing and responding to the world. In short, it takes some 
--- Page 239 ---
220 BASIC TREATMENT STRATEGIES 
humility—just the opposite of the superior position one takes when using 
sleight of hand or gimmicks. Of course, this does not rule out playing games, 
in the tme sense of having fun with the patient. But such games must be mutual 
and gentle to be effective. 
Each strategy described in this chapter can be misused or falsely applied. 
An aspect of paradox is that the statements appear to make no sense, to be 
nonsense; however, not all nonsense is paradoxical. Metaphor and storytel­
ling can be used to get out of answering a question directly, to divert atten­
tion, to fill time, or to show off. The story may be fascinating but may have 
no relationship to the problem at hand. The devil's advocate technique is best 
used when the therapist seleas a position to argue that has merit and vali­
dates the patient's tenacious hold on the particular dysfunctional rule or be­
lief. It is most badly used when the therapist humiliates the patient or makes 
her appear to be stupid or foolish. Extending can easily become hostile and 
sarcastic, especially when the therapist feels manipulated by the patient's 
threats or extreme responses. Aaivating "wise mind" has great potential to 
validate the patient's inherent wisdom; it can just as easily be used, however, 
to validate the therapist's sense of his or her own wisdom at the expense of 
the patient. Similarly, it is easy to forget that making lemonade requires a 
fair amount of sugar When the therapist fails to recognize that the patient 
does not have ready access to sugar herself, the result can leave a sour taste 
and diminish the patient's faith and confidence in the therapist. Natural change 
strategies can be a cover for a therapist's arbitrary inconsistency, failure to 
keep a promise, failure to plan therapy, or moodiness. Finally, dialectical as­
sessments, if not rigorously tested and evaluated, can create and justify their 
own illusions. Time-tested traditions and rules of therapeutic encounter can 
be violated thoughtlessly, sometimes with terrible consequences for the pa­
tient or for the therapist. The baby can indeed be thrown out with the bath 
water 
Notes 
1. To a greater or lesser extent, all therapeutic approaches highlight the same 
dialectical principles as discussed here. Psychodynamic therapies, for example, attend 
to dynamic tensions and conflicts within the person. Behavioral approaches attend 
to the wholistic relationship between the person and his or her environment. Cogni­
tive approaches focus extensively on observing and accepting reality as it is in the mo­
ment in a context of helping the patient change. Thus, in a very real sense, the emphasis 
on dialectics in DBT is "nothing new."

Core Strategies: 
Part I. 
Validation 
A is noted at the beginning of Chap­
ter 7, validation and problem-solving strategies form the core of DBT; all other 
strategies are built around them. Validation strategies are the most obvious 
and direct acceptance strategies in DBT. Validation communicates to the pa­
tient in a nonambiguous way that her behavior makes sense and is under­
standable in the current context. The therapist engages the patient in trying 
to understand her aaions, emotions, and thoughts or implicit rules. Problem-
solving strategies, by contrast, are the most obvious and direa change strate­
gies in DBT. In problem solving the therapist engages the patient in analyz­
ing her own behavior, committing to change, and taking aaive steps to change 
her behavior 
As discussed in Chapter 4, maladaptive behaviors are often the solutions 
to problems the patient wants solved or taken away. However, from the ther­
apist's point of view, these same behaviors are the problems to be solved. To 
oversimplify matters somewhat, validation strategies highlight the wisdom of 
the patient's point of view, and problem-solving strategies highlight the ther­
apist's. This statement is overly simple because sometimes the perspectives 
are switched: The patient views her own behavior as problematic and in need 
of change, whereas the therapist is focused on acceptance of the patient and 
her behavior just as it is. Both validation and problem-solving strategies are 
used in every interaction with the patient. Many treatment impasses result 
from an imbalance of one strategy over the other 
A borderline patient presents herself clinically as an individual in extreme 
emotional pain. She pleads, and at times demands, that the therapist do some­
thing to change this state of affairs—to make her feel better, stop doing des-
truaive things, and live her life more satisfactorily. It is very tempting, given 
221 
--- Page 241 ---
222 BASIC TREATMENT STRATEGIES 
the high distress of the patient and the difficulties in changing the world around 
her, to focus the energy of therapy on changing the patient. Depending on 
the therapist's orientation, treatment might focus on how the patient's irra­
tional thoughts, assumptions, or schemas contribute to dysfunctional nega­
tive emotions; how her inappropriate interpersonal behaviors or motives 
contribute to interpersonal problems; how her abnormal biology interferes 
with functional adaptation; how her emotional reactivity and intensity con­
tribute to her overall problems; and so forth. Therapy typically consists of 
applying technologies of change, with the focus of change on the patient's 
behavior, personality, or biological patterns. 
In many respects, this focus recapitulates the invalidating environment, 
in which the patient was the problem and the patient needed to change. When 
promoting change, a therapist may validate a patient's worst fears: The pa­
tient indeed cannot trust her own emotional reactions, cognitive interpreta­
tions, or behavioral responses. Mistrust and invalidation of one's own 
responses to events, whether self-generated or coming from others, however, 
are extremely aversive. Depending on circumstances, invalidation may elicit 
fear, anger, shame, or a combination of all three. Thus, the entire focus of 
change-based therapy can be aversive, since by necessity the focus contrib­
utes to and elicits self-invalidation. No wonder the patient often avoids or 
resists. 
Unfortunately, a therapeutic approach based on unconditional accep­
tance and validation of the patient's behaviors proves equally problematic and, 
paradoxically, can also be invalidating. If the therapist urges the patient to 
accept and validate herself, it can appear that the therapist does not regard 
the patient's problems seriously. The desperation of the borderline individu­
al is discounted in acceptance-based therapies, since little hope of change is 
offered. The patient's personal experience of her life as unacceptable and un­
endurable is thereby invalidated. 
To resolve this impasse, DBT attends to the balance of acceptance-based 
with change-based treatment strategies. A primary focus of treatment is teach­
ing the patient both to validate herself and to change. Most importantly, the 
therapy strives to help the patient understand that responses may prove both 
appropriate or valid and, at the same time, dysfunaional and in need of change 
(see Watts, 1990, for a simUar point). This balance point, however, constant­
ly changes; as a result, the therapist must be able to move and react flexibly 
and quickly in therapy The recognition of the need for flexibility and for 
the synthesis or balance of complementary or opposite poles is the reason 
why dialectics is used as a foundation for the therapy. 
Defining Validation 
The essence of validation is this: The therapist communicates to the patient 
that her responses make sense and are understandable within her current life 
--- Page 242 ---
Core Strategies: Part I. Validation 223 
context or situation. The therapist actively accepts the patient and commu­
nicates this acceptance to the patient. The therapist takes the patient's 
responses seriously and does not discount or trivialize them. Validation strate­
gies require the therapist to search for, recognize, and reflect to the patient 
the validity inherent in her responses to events. With unruly children, parents 
have to catch them while they're good in order to reinforce their behavior; 
simUarly, the therapist has to uncover the validity within the patient's response, 
sometimes amplify it, and then reinforce it. In the early period of individual 
treatment, validation strategies may be the principal strategies used in therapy. 
Sometimes it is easier to understand what validation means by under­
standing what it does not mean. Pointing out that a response was functional 
in the past, but is not now, is invalidating rather than validating. For exam­
ple, a patient may say that the therapist is always angry at her If the ther­
apist immediately denies it, and then points to how the patient's experiences 
in other intimate relationships might have reasonably led her to expect the 
therapist to be angry, the therapist is invalidating the patient's comment. The 
therapist may be showing that the patient is not crazy, and that in the con­
text of her previous experience her response would be valid, but not that her 
response is valid in the current context. Validating the patient's history is not 
the same as validating her current behavior 
Similarly, the therapist is invalidating the patient's response if her com­
ment is interpreted as a projeaion of her own anger onto the therapist. Almost 
any ad hominem (or, in this case, ad feminam) response, such as this one, 
invalidates the content of the patient's viewpoint. Although such arguments 
may also have validity, they do not validate the patient's comment, nor are 
they likely to be experienced as validating. A validating response would be 
for the therapist to first search openly for any expressive behavior on his or 
her part that might communicate anger, and then thoughtfully discuss with 
the patient the emotion or attitude that these behaviors reflea. Finally, validat­
ing is not simply making patients feel good or building up their self-esteem. 
If a patient says that she is stupid, saying that she is smart invalidates her 
experience of being stupid. 
There are three steps in validating. The first two are part of almost all 
therapy traditions; the third step, however, is essential to DBT. The steps are 
as foUows. 
1. Active observing. First, the therapist gathers information about what 
has happened to the patient or what is happening in the moment, and listens 
to and observes what the patient is thinking, feeling, and doing. The essence 
of this step is that the therapist is awake. The therapist lets go of theories, 
prejudices, and personal biases that get in the way of observing the actual 
emotions, thoughts, and behaviors of the patient. In agency and hospital set­
tings, the therapist lets go of gossip about the patient and other profession­
als' opinions about the patient. The therapist listens to direct communications 
and observes public acts. In addition, the therapist listens with a "third ear" 
--- Page 243 ---
224 BASIC TREATMENT STRATEGIES 
to hear the unstated emotions, thoughts, values, and beliefs; the therapist also 
observes with a "third eye" to guess the unstated aaion of the patient. At 
the beginning of therapy, the therapist often needs the ability to "read the 
patient's mind"; it can be similar to taking a photo in the dark on infrared 
film. Via therapeutic shaping, the patient progresses over time to being able 
to take such "photos" for herself. 
2. Reflection. Second, the therapist accurately reflects back to the pa­
tient the patient's ovm feelings, thoughts, assumptions, and behaviors. In this 
step, a nonjudgmental attitude is fundamental. The therapist communicates 
to the patient, in a way that the patient can hear, that the therapist is awake 
and listening. Accurate emotional empathy; understanding of (but not neces­
sarily agreement with) beliefs, expeaations, or assumptions; and recognition 
of behavioral patterns are required. Through back-and-forth discussion, the 
therapist helps the patient identify, describe, and label her own response pat­
terns. Thus, the patient has a a chance to say that the therapist is wrong. 
The therapist frequently asks "Is that right?" In reflecting, the therapist often 
states what the patient observes but is afraid to say or admit. This simple 
aa of reflection, especially when the therapist "says it first," can be a power­
ful act of validation: A borderline patient often observes herself accurately 
in the first place, but invalidates and discounts her own perceptions because 
of self-mistrust. 
3. Direct validation. Third, the therapist looks for and refleas the wis­
dom or validity of the patient's response, and communicates that the response 
is understandable. The therapist finds the stimuli in the current environment 
that support the patient's behavior Even though information regarding all 
the relevant causes may not be available, the patient's feelings, thoughts, and 
aaions make perfect sense in the context of the person's current experience 
and life to date. Behavior is adaptive to the context in which it occurs, and 
the therapist must find the wisdom of that adaptation. The therapist is not 
blinded by the dysfunaional nature of a patient's response but, instead, attends 
to those aspects of the response that may be either reasonable or appropriate 
to the context. Thus, the therapist searches the patient's responses for their 
inherent accuracy, appropriateness, or reasonableness before considering their 
more dysfunaional characteristics. Even if only a small part of the response 
is valid, the therapist searches out that portion of the behavior and responds 
to it. It is this third step that takes the most searching by the therapist and 
that defines validation most clearly By finding the validity in the patient's 
response, the therapist can honestly support the patient in validating herself. 
The search for validity is dialectical, in that the therapist must find the 
grain of wisdom and authenticity in a patient's responses that on the whole 
may have been dysfunctional. At times, validating a patient's response is like 
finding for a nugget of gold in a cup of sand. The assumption of DBT is 
that there is a nugget of gold in every cup of sand; there is some inherent 
validity in every response. Attention to the nugget of gold does not preclude 
--- Page 244 ---
Core Strategies: Part I. Validation 225 
attention to the sand, however Indeed, validation strategies are balanced by 
problem-solving strategies, which focus on finding and taking action on 
characteristics of the patient that must be changed. 
There are four types of validation strategies. The first three, emotional, 
behavioral, and cognitive validation, are very similar to one another They 
are distinguished in this chapter only to provide an opportunity to discuss 
some specific points that are often important in treating borderline patients. 
"Cheerleading" is different, in that the therapist is validating the inherent capa­
bilities of the patient—ones that are not always obvious to the patient. Thus, 
emotional, cognitive, and behavioral validation are experienced by the pa­
tient as vaHdating; cheerleading sometimes is not. Although each of these four 
strategies includes the three steps above, how the therapist puts these steps 
together can vary. 
Why Validate? 
Although the need for validation in treatment of borderline patients may be 
self-evident, especially to anyone who has read the previous seven chapters 
of this book, therapists often experience so much difficulty in maintaining 
a validating stance with borderline patients that the point cannot be repeated 
too often. To summarize the points I have made earlier, validation is needed 
first to balance change strategies. The amount of validation needed per unit 
of change focus will vary among patients and for a particular patient over 
time. Generally, the patient who is unassertive, is nonverbal, and tends to 
withdraw when confronted will need a higher validation-to-change ratio that 
the combative patient who, though equally vulnerable and sensitive, can "stay 
the course" when feeling attacked. For all patients, when stress in the environ­
ment (both within and outside of the therapy relationship) goes up, the 
validation-change quotient must also go up accordingly. Similarly, when par­
ticularly sensitive topics are being addressed, validation should be increased. 
Even within a particular session, the need for therapist validation can be ex­
pected to vary. Therapy with a borderline patient can be likened to pushing 
an individual ever closer to the edge of a sheer cliff. As the back of the per­
son's heel rubs the edge, validation is used to pull the person back from the 
precipice toward the safe ground where the therapist is. 
Second, validation is needed to teach the patient to validate herself. As 
I have discussed in Chapter 2, the borderline individual is often faced with 
two incompatible but very strong sources of information: her own intense 
response to events on the one hand, and others' discrepant, but often equally 
intense, responses on the other hand. Although DBT does not assume that 
borderline patients do not at times distort events, the first line of approach 
is always to discover the aspect of an event that is not being distorted. Distor­
tion of events is often a consequence rather than a cause of emotional dys­
function. The experience of self-mistrust is intensely aversive when it is long-
--- Page 245 ---
226 BASIC TREATMENT STRATEGIES 
standing and pervasive. At a minimum, people have to trust their own deci­
sion on whom to believe—themselves or others. Exaggeration of events is often 
an attempt to obtain validation for an original, quite valid perspective on 
events. I often point out to patients that one of my goals in therapy is to help 
them learn to trust their own response. 
The secrets to effective use of validation are knowing when to use it and 
when not to, and, once it is begun, when to cut it off. This can be a special 
problem when intense emotions are present or elicited. For some patients, 
if the therapist allowed it, therapy would be little more than emotional cathar­
sis. The abUity to shut off emotional expression and get to problem solving 
is important if progress is to be made. In particular, it is important that the 
therapist not use validation strategies immediately foUowing dysfunctional 
behaviors that are maintained by their tendency to elicit validation from the 
environment. (The use of therapeutic contingencies to modify behavior is dis­
cussed at length in Chapter 10.) At times the best strategy is to ignore a pa­
tient's current distress and plunge into problem solving, dragging the patient 
along, so to speak, as best one can. Validation can be a brief comment or 
digression while working on other issues, or it can be the focus of an entire 
session. As with other DBT strategies, the use of these must be goal-oriented 
and purposeful. That is, they should be used when the immediate goal is to 
calm a patient who is too emotionally aroused to talk about anything else; 
to repair therapeutic errors; to develop the patient's skills in nonjudgmental 
self-observation and nonpejorative self-descriptions (i.e., to teach her self-
validation); to learn about the patient's current experiences or experiences 
accompanying an event; or to provide a validating context for change. 
EMOTIONAL VALIDATION STRATEGIES 
Borderline patients vacUlate between emotional inhibition and intense emo­
tional reactivity. Some patients characteristically inhibit emotional expression 
during therapy interactions; other patients always seem to be in a state of 
emotional crisis; still others cycle back and forth. These phases have been 
described in detail in Chapters 3 and 5. Emotional validation poses different 
challenges, depending on which phase the patient is in. With the inhibited 
individual, emotional expression is like the small flame of a campfire on a 
rainy day. The therapist has to be very careful not to smother the emotion 
with overly facile observations, explanations, and interpretations. Teaching 
the patient to observe her own emotions, being able to read emotions from 
minimal information, and remaining open to the possibility of guessing wrong 
are all important. With the emotionally reactive patient, by contrast, the 
challenge is to validate the emotion without escalating it at the same time. 
Providing opportunities for emotional expression and reflecting emotions are 
important in this case. 
Emotional validation sttategies contrast with approaches that focus on 
--- Page 246 ---
Core Strategies: Part I. Validation 227 
the overreactivity of emotions or the distorted basis of their generation. Thus, 
they are more like the approach of Greenberg and Safran (1987), who make 
a distinction between primary or "authentic" emotions and secondary or 
"learned" emotions. The latter are reactions to primary cognitive appraisals 
and emotional responses; they are the end products of chains of feelings and 
thoughts. Dysfunctional and maladaptive emotions, according to Greenberg 
and Safran, are usuaUy secondary emotions that block the experience and 
expression of primary emotions. These authors go on to suggest that "all 
primary affective emotion provides adaptive motivational information to the 
organism" (1987, p. 176). The important point here is the suggestion that 
dysfunctional and maladaptive responses to events are often connected or in­
terwoven with "authentic" or valid responses to events. Finding and amplify­
ing these primary responses constitute the essence of emotional validation. 
The honesty of the therapist in applying these strategies cannot be overstressed. 
If emotional validation strategies are used as change strategies—that is, if lip 
service is given to validation in order simply to calm the patient down for 
the "real work"—the therapist can expea the therapy to backfire. Such honesty, 
in turn, depends on the therapist's belief that there is substantial validity to 
be found, and that searching for it is therapeutically useful. 
A borderline individual commonly cannot identify the emotions she is 
experiencing, usually because she is experiencing a variety of emotions simul­
taneously or in rapid succession. In some instances, the patient's secondary 
emotional response (e.g., fear, shame, or anger) to her primary emotion may 
be so intense or extreme as to disrupt or inhibit the primary emotion before 
the patient has a chance to experience, process, or articulate. At other times, 
the patient may experience a single emotion intensely and may report being 
upset, but cannot get past that depiaion to a fuller description of the emo­
tion. The patient may report that in daily encounters she becomes aware of 
her emotions only after the fact. An important focus of therapy is on helping 
the patient observe and describe her current emotional state in a nonjudg­
mental fashion, taking care to separate descriptions of the emotion from 
descriptions of the events that led to the emotion. 
A borderUne patient often withdraws from very intense emotions, showing 
few overt indications of emotional arousal. Very passive behavior is some­
times an indication that the patient is avoiding or inhibiting all emotional 
responses that would otherwise be elicited under the current conditions. At 
times, the escape or avoidance will be incomplete, and the individual will 
reaa with part of an emotional response while inhibiting other parts. For 
example, the patient may have a phenomenological experience of sadness or 
fear without the facial or postural expressive aspect of the emotion, or vice 
versa. Or the patient may have an aaion urge usually associated with an emo­
tion (e.g., to scream, to run out of the session, or to hit the therapist) with 
no corresponding emotional experience or physiological changes. DBT does 
not assume that the patient is experiencing the emotion unconsciously, and 
thus just doesn't know it. The patient who wants to hit the therapist is not 
--- Page 247 ---
228 BASIC TREATMENT STRATEGIES 
necessarily assumed to be angry at him or her In faa, in this latter case the 
problem may be that the patient is not reaaing with anger That is, she is 
avoiding or inhibiting the flow of a response that would ordinarily occur 
For the patient who is inhibiting emotional experience and expression, 
the therapist must be careful to validate both the emotion that is being in­
hibited and the difficulties the patient is having in expressing it spontaneous­
ly. Understanding the inhibition will generally require skUlful behavioral 
assessment (described in detail in Chapter 9). For example, the patient may 
automatically avoid emotional responses or inhibit emotional expression as 
a result of classical conditioning experiences. (See Chapter 3.) Secondary emo­
tions, as noted above, typically cut off or interfere with the full experience 
and/or expression of the primary emotions. Finally, many patients have very 
strong moral beliefs about the appropriateness of various emotions. 
For the patient who is in an emotional crisis or is expressing intense emo­
tions, the therapist has to take great care not to use invalidation as a tech­
nique to dampen the emotion—an all-too-common strategy. In my experience, 
one of therapists' greatest fears is that if they recognize or validate borderline 
patients' emotional experiences, they are rewarding the emotional behavior 
and it will continue and even escalate. At other times, therapists, like their 
patients, feel that if they validate the patients they are invalidating themselves. 
The temptation is then to try punishment to reduce the emotion. This rarely 
works; even when it does, the patients usually revert to emotional inhibition, 
only to respond intensely the next time the same situation is encountered. 
Once a patient feels heard, listened to, and taken seriously, however, she will 
usually calm down. Indeed, if the therapist takes the patient's emotions more 
seriously than the patient is taking them (the dialectical strategy of extend­
ing), the patient may aaually start to reassure the therapist. Specific emo­
tional validation strategies are discussed below and summarized in Table 8.1. 
I. PROVIDING OPPORTUNITIES FOR 
EMOTIONAL EXPRESSION 
A patient in a state of overwhelming crisis often requires a substantial part 
of the session for emotional expression and processing. Efforts on the part 
of the therapist to control intense emotional expressions may be met with 
strong resistance, including statements that the therapist does not understand 
her In these instances, the therapist should simply listen, identify, clarify, and 
directly validate the patient's feelings in a nonjudgmental manner As noted 
above, the patient will gradually calm down and be ready for more focused 
problem solving. Open-ended questions about feelings at this point are prob­
ably not useful. Generally, they will simply prolong the emotional intensity, 
whereas reflective statements about either the patient's feelings or environ­
mental state may help diffuse the intensity. 
Opportunities for emotional expression are just as important for the in­
hibited patient. Here, however, the task is to provide enough structure to in-

duce communication of emotions, while not imposing so much stmaure that 
the patient withdraws further "Enough structure" generally involves asking 
questions about emotional reactions and leaving enough sUence for the pa­
tient to respond. Patience and the ability to tolerate silence are requisite here. 
Needed also is the ability to judge when a silence has gone on too long. Long 
sUences can induce further withdrawal. Instead, after a reasonable silence the 
therapist should engage in solitary verbal patter, punctuated with questions 
about what the patient is feeling and silences for response, until the patient 
begins to talk again. 
2. TEACHING EMOTION OBSERVATION 
AND LABELING SKILLS 
SkiUs in observing and labeling emotional experiences and states are an im­
portant target of the skills training module in emotion regulation. The ther­
apist must know these skills and help the patient integrate them into daily 
Hfe. The therapist may also need to teach these skills explicitly when there 
is no separate skills training component to the therapy or when that portion 
of the skills training occurs too long after the skills are needed. Some border­
line patients are quite good at observing and describing emotions; others have 
minimal abilities, often existing in an emotional fog. They know they are 
feeling something, but they have little or no idea of what they are feeling or 
how to put it into words. With these patients it is often useful to teach them 
first how to observe and describe the components of emotions, without neces­
sarily having to put labels on their feelings right away. 
There are many theories of emotions, and just as many theories of the 
components of emotional responses. In DBT we teach patients how to ob­
serve and describe the prompting events (either intemal or external); thoughts 
and interpretations associated with the event; sensory and physical responses 
associated with the emotional experience; desires and wishes associated with 
the experience (e.g., wanting the best for a person or wanting to be close to 
a loved one); and associated action tendencies (e.g., "I feel like hitting him," 
"My feet want to run"). Information about the emotion being experienced 
can also be obtained from overt reaaions that may be expressions of the emo­
tion, such as facial and body expressions, words used or things said, and ac­
tions. Finally, it can also be useful to examine the aftereffects of an emotion. 
For example, feeling secure and trusting when near someone is more indica­
tive of love than of anger 
At times, information about prompting events is all that is needed to 
figure out an emotional response. If one person threatens to kill another, the 
other wUl most likely respond with fear; sadness usually follows the death 
of a loved one. Because of their idiosyncratic and cultural leaming experiences, 
however, individuals may vary in their emotional responses to different situa­
tions. A further complicating factor is that most individuals, including bor­
derline patients, have difficulty discriminating prompting events (e.g., "He 
--- Page 250 ---
Core Strategies: Part I. Validation 231 
spoke to me with a curt tone of voice," "My heart is racing") from their in­
terpretations of the events (e.g., "He hates me," "I am having a panic attack 
and wUl humiliate myself). The ability to separate actual events from infer­
ences about the events is an important first step in cognitive therapy approaches 
and is also important in DBT. 
Self-observation requires further that a patient step back and note the 
presence of physical sensations, feelings, emotion-laden, or "hot" thoughts, 
and action tendencies. At times, getting the patient to slow down and ob­
serve her own responses is the only way for the therapist to get enough infor­
mation to respond helpfully to the patient. Although the DBT therapist is 
expected to "read the patient's emotions," at least in the initial stages of ther­
apy (see below), information about how the patient is actually responding 
makes this much easier Otherwise, identifying the patient's emotions can 
sometimes feel like a guessing game. Most people, including borderline pa­
tients, find it extremely difficult to observe emotional responses without be­
ing carried away by them. Indeed, emotion observation is also an emotion 
regulation technique. Thus, it can be useful to help the patient praaice reflec­
tive self-observation during therapy sessions and in phone interactions. 
Techniques for helping a patient learn to observe, describe, and label 
ongoing emotions include questioning and making comments about the 
prompting events; instructing the patient in how to step back and observe 
her ongoing cognitive, physiological, and nonverbal action responses; and 
focusing on normative responses of other people in similar situations. Filling 
out "Observing and Describing Emotions" homework sheets from the emo­
tion regulation skills training module (see the companion manual to this 
volume) can also be quite useful. The advantage of these sheets is that the 
patient can use them between sessions to work on identifying emotions. 
Sometimes a patient expereinces the very idea that one can reflectively 
observe an emotion as invalidating of the emotion. The patient's tendency 
to take the emotion literally, as information about the precipitating event rather 
than about her response to the precipitating event, is the difficulty here. The 
suggestion that one can or should observe the emotion implies that the 
"problem" is the emotion, not what set it off. To counter this, the therapist 
should surround the request to observe with communications that validate 
the emotion. 
3. READING EMOTIONS 
Reading emotions is the emotional equivalent of reading someone's mind. 
A therapist who is a good reader of emotions can figure out how the patient 
feels just by knowing what has happened to her; he or she can make the link 
between precipitating event and emotion without being given any informa­
tion about the emotion itself. This is almost always experienced as validat­
ing of the patient's emotional experience. The message communicated is that 
the patient's emotional responses to events are normal, predictable and un-
--- Page 251 ---
232 BASIC TREATMENT STRATEGIES 
derstandable; how else would the therapist know how the patient feels? In 
contrast, when the therapist cannot figure out how the patient feels unless 
the patient spells it out in detaU, this is often experienced as invalidating, 
insensitive, or uncaring. 
Many therapists are unwilling or unable to read patients' emotions, in­
sisting instead that the patients state verbally how they are feeling or what 
they want. It is not unusual to hear therapists say to patients, "I can't read 
your mind," in a tone of voice clearly implying that expecting the therapists 
to know how the patients feel without being told is somehow pathological. 
Patients' demands that therapists do this are common complaints at case con­
ferences. Yet a moment's reflection teUs us that the abUity to know how another 
feels without being told directly is an essential and expeaed social skill in 
ordinary interpersonal relationships. If a loved one dies, a person is fired, a 
house is burned in a fire, a large account is won or lost at work, or a child 
wins a coveted prize, most people would expect others to know how they 
feel and to aa accordingly. In many conflicts between groups, the issue is 
just this —the complaint of one group that the other is insensitive and cannot 
understand the first group's emotions unless everything is spelled out in de­
taU. Men don't understand women; Caucasians can't see life from the per­
spective of African-Americans; the rich misunderstand the poor; and so on. 
Demanding that others understand us better, or develop the ability to read 
our emotions, is not unique to borderline patients. In each case, the problem 
is that people of one cultural background have difficulty reading the emo­
tions of those from another background. And this is the state of affairs be­
tween borderline patients and most therapists. They have very different life 
experiences, making it difficult for each to understand the other Patients have 
not had the inculturation that makes a therapist; most therapists have not 
had experiences close to those of the borderline patient. 
Among the more common and important emotional assertions made by 
borderline and suicidal patients are variants of the statement that they "don't 
care any more." Such comments are important because they afford the poten­
tial of invalidating emotions that are very central to the patients' opinion of 
themselves. A patient may say that she doesn't want to try any more, or that 
she doesn't care about something she previously cared very much about. When 
taken literally, these comments cut off further collaborative work between 
patient and therapist, at least with respect to the topic under consideration. 
At times, the patient's statement that she doesn't care refleas the therapist's 
secret beHef ("If she cared, she would try harder, do better, etc."). Thus, there 
is a temptation to agree with the patient that she doesn't care or doesn't want 
to improve. At other times, the therapist experiences the patient's statement 
as manipulative ("Obviously she cares; she is just saying that to play games 
or get something from me"). The therapist responds with veiled hostility or 
coldness. Both responses can be experienced by the patient as invalidating 
of her true emotional state. Not caring any more is usually a frustration 
response and an attempt on the part of the patient to avoid the cycle of car-
--- Page 252 ---
Core Strategies: Part I. Validation 233 
ing and subsequent disappointment. It is useful for the therapist to respond 
to this by stating to the patient that she would probably care if she let herself, 
and that the problem may be one of feeling helpless and hopeless rather than 
one of not caring. Simply recognizing the patient's sense of being out of con­
trol can be useful in helping the patient identify her avoidance strategy 
Reading emotions requires some familiarity by the therapist with the cul­
ture of the patient. Knowledge of the patient's current situation or the 
precipitating situation, together with observations of the patient's verbal and 
nonverbal behavior, can be useful in arriving at a description of the patient's 
emotional responses. The link between events and emotions is in part universal 
but in part learned. Thus, to the extent that the therapist's and patient's learn­
ing histories are similar, the therapist wUl be adept at emotion reading. In 
the absence of such similarity, clinical experience (especially with borderline 
patients) and books and movies about people like the patient can be helpful. 
A very important task of the case consultation group is to assist the therapist 
in this work. 
Timing 
Reading emotions is essential at the beginning of therapy with the borderline 
patient, but it should be tapered off as therapy progresses. As a strategy, it 
is both very powerful as a validating technique and at the same time is fraught 
with difficulty. The main problem is that when the therapist reads the pa­
tient's emotions, the patient does not have to learn how to read her own emo­
tions. The therapist is doing the work, not the patient. Second, having the 
therapist read her emotions is usually very comforting to the patient. Thus, 
when the therapist starts to taper it off—to insist on the patient's improving 
her ability to read her own emotions —this can be experienced as punishing 
and uncaring. Third, when the therapist verbalizes the patient's emotions, 
it lets the patient avoid verbalizing them herself. Thus the exposure to talk­
ing about her emotions is further avoided, and the development of comfort 
in discussing emotions may be impeded. Finally, avoiding emotional expres­
siveness allows the patient to avoid emotional self-validation. 
In the beginning of therapy, and sometimes well after therapy has be­
gun, the therapit's refusal to read the patients' emotions often produces esca­
lation of an emotion until it is finally expressed openly, but in an extreme 
and often maladaptive way. In other words, the emotion is only expressed 
when the experience of it is more intense than the counterbalancing experience 
of shame, fear, or self-invalidation. At this point, the patient may cut herself 
or attempt suicide, or may rigidly adhere to a point of view that supports 
an extreme emotional response. Before the patient has leamed to inhibit such 
maladaptive behaviors, the therapist's withholding of emotion reading to force 
the patient to express her emotions is probably counterproductive. However, 
once these behaviors are under control and the patient can adequately toler­
ate distress, continuing to read emotions is itself counterproductive. In ef-
--- Page 253 ---
234 BASIC TREATMENT STRATEGIES 
feet, the therapist's task becomes teaching the patient the skUls of emotional 
experiencing and expression. This is especially true of the final stage of DBT, 
in which developing self-respect and learning self-validation are the primary 
targets. Principles of skills training (including shaping, discussed in Chapter 
11) are relevant here. 
Offering Multiple-Choice Emotion Questions 
One danger in emotion reading is that the therapist will misread an emotion 
but the patient will agree anyway. She may do this because of simple confu­
sion, fear of disagreeing with or disappointing the therapist, or a belief that 
her actual emotions are so bad that she can not admit them. An alternative 
strategy is to offer the patient a range of emotion labels to choose from-for 
instance, "Are you feeling angry, hurt, sad, or all three?" The advantage here 
is that such questions are not open-ended. Borderline patients often simply 
can not answer open ended questions about their current emotions. Multiple-
choice emotion questions give the patients some choice but not too much. 
4. COMMUNICATING THE VALIDITY OF EMOTIONS 
The single best way to validate a patient's emotional experience is for the 
therapist to communicate direaly that he or she finds the emotional response 
understandable. Iwo types of understanding can be communicated here. First, 
the patient can be informed that almost anyone (or at least many people) would 
respond to the emotion-generating situation in much the same way that she 
is responding. This is normative validation. Second, the patient can be helped 
to see that given her past learning experiences, her emotional reaction (even 
if others would reaa differently) is understandable within that context. In 
both instances, however, the emphasis is on identifying those aspects of the 
current situation that prompt the emotion. 
It is important that the therapist validate not only the primary emotion­
al experience, but also the secondary emotional response. For example, a pa­
tient often feels guUty, ashamed, angry at herself, or panicky if she experiences 
anger or humiliation, feels dependent on the therapist, begins to cry, grieves, 
or is afraid. These secondary responses are often the most debilitating for 
the patient. Patients who hold religious beliefs about the morality of various 
emotional responses should be helped to explore the validity of these beliefs. 
Although the therapist must be careful not to challenge such patients' moral 
standards, a patient's prohibitions against various emotions are often based 
on a faulty understanding of her own religious tradition. 
Emotional validation is an essential first step in any attempt to help the 
patient moderate her responses. Thus, it is rarely useful to respond to what 
seems to be an unwarranted emotion by instruaing the patient that she need 
not feel that way. The therapist may frequently be tempted to do this when 
the patient is responding emotionally to the therapist. For example, if a pa-
--- Page 254 ---
Core Strategies: Part I. Validation 235 
tient calls the therapist at home (according to the treatment plan) and then 
feels guUty or humiliated about doing so, it is a natural tendency for the ther­
apist to tell the patient that she need not feel this way. This should be recog­
nized as an invalidating statement. Although the therapist may want to 
communicate that calling the therapist is acceptable and understandable, it 
is also understandable that the patient feels guilty and humUiated. 
Most often, invalidation of a patient's feelings will arise from the ther­
apist's overanxious attempts to help the patient feel better immediately. Such 
tendencies should be resisted, because they counter an important message 
that the therapy is attempting to communicate —namely, that negative and 
painful emotions are not only understandable but tolerable. In addition, if 
the therapist responds to the patient's negative emotions by either ignoring 
them, teUing the patient that she need not feel that way, or focusing too quickly 
on changing the emotions, the therapist mns the risk of behaving just as others 
in the patient's natural environment have done. The attempt to control emo­
tions by willpower, or to "think happy" and to avoid negative thoughts, is 
a key characteristic of the invalidating environment. The therapist must be 
sure not to fall into this trap. 
BEHAVIORAL VALIDATION STRATEGIES 
Behavioral validation strategies are used in every session. They constitute the 
main response to the tendency of borderline patients to invalidate and pun­
ish their own behavior pattems. Behavioral validation can focus on behaviors 
a patient notes on her diary card, other behaviors during the week, or be­
haviors occurring during the therapy session or interaaion with the therapist. 
The basic idea is to elicit a clear description of the behaviors in question and 
then to communicate their essential understandability. Behavioral validation 
is based on the notion that all behavior is caused by events occurring in time, 
and thus (in principle, at least) is understandable. The therapist's task is to 
search out the validity of the patient's response and to reflect that aspect of 
the behavior Although these strategies are being discussed in terms of overt 
behaviors and aaions, they can be applied equaUy well to helping patients 
accept their own emotional reactions, decisions, beliefs, and thoughts; they 
are discussed here for convenience's sake. The behavioral validation strate­
gies are summarized in Table 8.2. 
I. TEACHING BEHAVIOR OBSERVATION 
AND LABELING SKILLS 
Describing behavior and its patterns is an essential part of any psychothera­
py. Borderline patients can be remarkably unaware of both their own behavior 
pattems and the effeas of their behavior on others. Often this is the case 
because other people have described their behavior to them in terms of pre-

sumed motives (e.g., "You are trying to control me") or the effects of the be­
havior on the observers (e.g., "You are manipulating me"), rather than in purely 
behavioral terms ("You are changing the topic"). Although these may be ac­
curate descriptions of the observers' experience, they often are not accurate 
descriptions of the patients' experience; thus, the feedback is dismissed or 
argued against. Energy that could go into understanding their own actual 
behavior patterns and their effects, regardless of the motives or intended ef­
fects, is diverted into self-defense. 
Both behavioral analysis and insight strategies, discussed in the next chap­
ter, are important techniques for teaching a patient how to observe and 
describe her own behavior The point I want to make here is that describing 
behavior, without adding inferred motives and judgments, can itself be a

validating response. This is all the more so when the therapist helps the pa­
tient recognize self-invalidating and self-judgmental descriptions of her own 
behavior For a borderline patient, "I was stupid" may be a more typical 
description of missing a bus than "I went to the bus stop too late to catch 
the bus." 
2. IDENTIFYING THE "SHOULD" 
Borderline and suicidal patients often express extreme anger, guilt, or disap­
pointment in themselves because they have behaved in ways that they find 
unacceptable. Almost without exception, such feelings will be based on some 
belief system that they "should not" have acted in the manner they did, or 
that they "should" have acted differently. In other words, these patients place 
unrealistic demands upon themselves to behave differently than they do. A 
key step in behavioral validation is helping a patient identify this type of self-
imposed demand. Although the patient may state openly that she shouldn't 
have done what she did, other statements communicate the same message 
only indirealy (e.g., "Why did I do that?", "How could I have done that?", 
"That was stupid!"). Learning to identify unspoken "shoulds" is an impor­
tant skill. 
The use of magical "shoulds" by a borderline individual is one of the 
most important factors interfering with behavioral shaping. Believing that 
she should be different already prohibits the patient from putting together 
a realistic plan to bring about desired changes. Indeed, in an invalidating fam­
ily it is the imposition of unrealistic "shoulds" that substantially inhibit teach­
ing the patient how to change her own behavior Thus, imposing "shoulds" 
recapitulates the invalidation that the individual experienced in growing up. 
Highlighting this for the patient can be helpful in promoting change. 
3. COUNTERING THE "SHOULD" 
The first step in countering "shoulds" is to make a distinction between un­
derstanding how or why something happened and approving of the event. 
The main resistance to believing that an event should have happened, given 
the circumstances surrounding it, is the belief that if a behavior is understood 
it is also approved of. The therapist must emphasize that the act of refusing 
to accept a given reality means that one cannot act to overcome or change 
that reality. Simple examples can be given here. The therapist can point to 
a nearby wall and suggest that if an individual wants the wall to be char­
treuse in color and refuses to accept the fact that the wall is currently not 
chartreuse, it is unlikely that the person will ever paint the wall chartreuse. 
A second point is being made here as well: Wishing that reality were different 
does not change it; believing that reality is what one wants it to be does not 
make it so. At times, a statement that something shouldn't be is also tanta­
mount to denying its existence: "Since it isn't acceptable, it couldn't happen." 
--- Page 257 ---
238 BASIC TREATMENT STRATEGIES 
The counterstatement to this is "It is" or "It happened." The task is to get 
the patient to agree that neither wishing nor denying will change reality. 
A useful step in countering "shoulds" is to present a mechanistic expla­
nation of causality, indicating that every event has a cause. The therapist can 
go through a number of examples of unwanted, undesirable behaviors with 
step-by-step illustrations of the factors that brought the events about. The 
strategy is to show that thoughts ("I don't want it") and emotions (fear, anger) 
are not sufficient to keep an event from happening. The notion to be com­
municated is that everything that happens should happen, given the context 
of the world; in principle, everything is understandable. 
Countering the "should" can require a substantial amount of time, and 
the therapist may need to have many stories and metaphors at hand to illus­
trate the point. For example, I usually tell a story about boxes rolling down 
a conveyor belt and out of a building. The boxes tumble out of the building 
everywhere. A person driving by would not believe that he or she could get 
the boxes to stop tumbling out of the building just by yelling at them to stop, 
or just by wanting desperately enough for them to stop. No, the person would 
assume that he or she would have to get out of the car and go into the build­
ing to figure out what is wrong. Knowing what is going on in the building 
will make it clear why the boxes are rolling out into the yard. People, together 
with their pasts, are often like buildings that no one can see into. Another 
example I use is to hold something in my hand and pretend that it is a glass 
of red wine, simultaneously pretending that the carpet is a brand-new white 
carpet. As I keep dropping the object on the floor, I keep asking whether 
the glass should not drop when let go. Why does it drop if I don't want it 
to? After this point is made, I move my hand under the object as it drops, 
catching it. The point is that for the glass not to drop on the carpet (once 
my hand opens), something has to be done to stop it. 
It is very important to cover these principles in a rather abstraa way near 
the beginning of therapy and to get the patient to agree on the abstraa prin­
ciples. If the skills training modules are being administered, these points are 
usuaUy discussed while the patient is learning both mindfulness skills and 
distress tolerance. Getting a patient to accept the idea that a nonjudgmental 
stance is preferable to a judgmental stance almost always requires a thorough 
discussion of these ideas. Throughout the remainder of therapy, the therapist 
can refer back to these principles, noting that the patient has already agreed 
to them, and can point out their application in the individual case. As thera­
py progresses, the patient will begin catching herself and her "shoulds." This, 
of course, is to be encouraged and reinforced. 
4. ACCEPTING THE "SHOULD" 
Often one event must occur for a second event to occur ("If A, then B"; "If 
not A, then not B"). It is common and appropriate to use the term "should" 
in a statement when one is referring to something that must happen in order 
--- Page 258 ---
Core Strategies: Part I. Validation 239 
for something else to happen. Thus, the following phrase is appropriate: "A 
should happen in order to produce J3." It is very important that the therapist 
accept the patient's preferences about her own behavior. The patient may often 
prefer to behave in certain ways or may want various outcomes that demand 
prior behavior patterns. In these instances, the therapist must be alert to ac­
cepting the "shoulds," and communicate to the patient the validity of her prefer­
ences. Together, the therapist and patient can explore the validity of the 
"should in order to" sequence. At times, a patient wiU be making inaccurate 
prediaions (e.g., "A is not needed in order for B to occur"). At other times, 
a patient's predictions are quite accurate. In this instance, the therapist is look­
ing for the nugget of truth in the patient's behavior. 
5. MOVING TO DISAPPOINTMENT 
It is easy for the therapist to get caught up in invalidating the patient's 
"shoulds" without recognizing that it is important to avoid invalidating the 
patient's quite understandable disappointment in her own behavior In the 
context of any brief discussion, it is important for the therapist to altemate 
between validating the events as understandable and validating the disappoint­
ment as equally understandable. Certain behaviors both should and should 
not occur When this happens, an appropriate response is disappointment. 
COGNITIVE VALIDATION STRATEGIES 
Intense emotions can precipitate emotion-congruent thoughts, memories, and 
images; conversely, thoughts, memories, and images can have powerful in­
fluences on mood. Thus, once an intense emotional response starts, a vicious 
circle is often set up: The emotion sets off memories, images, and thoughts 
and influences perceptions and processing of information, which in tum feed 
back into the emotional response, keeping it going. In such instances, distor­
tions can take on a life of their own and may color many, if not most, of 
the individual's interaaions and responses to events. Not aU mood-related 
thoughts, perceptions, expectancies, memories, and assumptions, however, 
are dysfunctional or distorted. This point is crucial in conduaing DBT. 
DBT does not assume that borderiine individuals' problems stem primar­
ily from dysfunaional cognitive styles, faulty interpretations and distortions 
of events, and maladaptive underlying assumptions or cognitive schemas. Be­
cause borderline patients sometimes distort, sometimes exaggerate, and some­
times remember selectively, it is common for the people around them 
(including therapists) to assume that their thinking and perceptions are al­
ways faulty, or at least that in disagreements the borderline individuals are 
more likely to be incorrect. Such assumptions are especially likely when full 
information about events precipitating an individual's emotional response is 
not available —that is, the stimuli setting off the individual's reaction are not 
--- Page 259 ---
240 BASIC TREATMENT STRATEGIES 
public. Especially when the borderline individual is experiencing intense emo­
tions, it is easy for another person to assume that the individual is distorting 
somehow. Things are not, or cannot be, as bad as she says. The trap here 
is that assumptions take the place of assessment; hypothesis and interpreta­
tions take the place of analysis of the facts. The other person's private in­
terpretation is taken as a guide to public facts. Such a scenario replicates the 
invalidating environment. 
The task of the therapist in cognitive validation is to recognize, verbal­
ize, and understand the patient's expressed and unexpressed thoughts, be­
liefs, expeaations, and underlying assumptions or rules, and to find and reflea 
the essential truth of aU or part of these. The strategies for "catching thoughts," 
identifying assumptions and expeaancies, and uncovering rules that are guid­
ing the individual's behavior, especially when these rules are operating out­
side of awareness, differ little from the guidelines outlined by cognitive 
therapists such as Beck and his colleagues (Beck et al., 1979; Beck et al., 1990). 
The essential difference is that the task in DBT is validation rather than em­
pirical refutation or logical challenge. 
A borderline individual has usually been raised in a "crazy-making" fa­
mily where her perceptions of reality were often invalidated. The struggle for 
the patient, then, is to learn to discriminate when her perceptions, thoughts, 
and beliefs are valid and when they are not—when she can trust herself and 
when she cannot. The task of the therapist is to assist in this process. An 
exclusive focus on the patient's invalid beliefs, assumptions, and cognitive styles 
is counterproductive, since it leaves the patient unsure of when (if ever) her 
perceptions and thoughts are adaptive, functional, and valid. Specific cogni­
tive validation strategies are described below and summarized in Table 8.3. 
I. ELICITING AND REFLECTING THOUGHTS 
AND ASSUMPTIONS 
The first task in cognitive validation is to figure out exactiy what the patient 
is thinking, what her assumptions and expectancies are, and what constructs 
she is using to organize her worid. This is easier said than done, because bor­
derline individuals often cannot articulate exactly what they are thinking. At 
times, thoughts rush through their minds too quickly for them to identify; 
at other times, their assumptions and expectancies are implicit rather than 
explicit. Passive expectancies, for example, are automatic, effortiess, and 
difficult to verbalize, as opposed to active expeaancies, which are conscious, 
occupy attention, and are easy to describe (WUliams, 1993). 
2. DISCRIMINATING FACTS FROM INTERPRETATIONS 
It is easy to assume that a patient is distorting what she observes; it is much 
more difficult to ascertain just what a patient is observing. The task here is 
to make private events public. The therapist should carefiiUy question the pa-

T helps P OBSERVE AND DESCRIBE (points out or elicits P's recognition-
e.g., by Socratic questioning) her own thought processes (automatic 
thoughts, underlying assumptions). 
T identifies constructs P uses to organize her world. 
T identifies meaning P attaches to events. 
T identifies P's basic assumptions about herself and the world. 
T helps P observe and describe "crazy-making" experiences. 
T listens to and discusses P's point of view in nonjudgmental fashion. 
. T helps P assess the facts and DIFFERENTIATE EVENTS FROM INTER­
PRETATIONS of events. 
. T searches for the "KERNEL OF TRUTH" in P's way of viewing events. 
When appropriate, T uses T-P interactions to demonstrate to P that 
while her grasp of reality may not be complete, neither is it incomplete. 
. T ACKNOWLEDGES "WISE MIND"; T communicates to P that intuitive 
knowledge can be as valid as empirically verifiable knowledge. 
. T RESPECTS DIFFERING VALUES; T does not insist on validity of his or 
her own values over P's. 
Anti-DBT tartics 
. T pushes a particular set of values or philosophical position on reality and truth. 
. T presents a rigid view of events. 
. T is unable to see reality from the perspective of P. 
tient about just what has happened and who did what to whom. As I have 
noted earlier, discriminating events from the interpretations of the events can 
be very difficult. Often the patient offers an interpretation of the observed 
behavior of another ("He wants to fire me") or an expeaation derived from 
an observation ("He is going to fire me"). The therapist should ask, "What 
did he do to make you believe that?" The crucial element here is the initial 
assumption that the other person did something, and that the patient's in­
terpretation is likely to be reasonable in some fashion. The goal in this case 
is to uncover the empirical basis of the patient's beliefs. 
3. FINDING THE "KERNEL OF TRUTH" 
The next task is to find and highlight the thoughts and assumptions of the 
patient that are valid or make sense within the context she is operating in. 
The idea is not that individuals (including borderline individuals) always 
"make sense," or that they do not at times exaggerate or minimize, think in 
extremes, devalue what is valuable and idealize what is ordinary, and make 
dysfunaional decisions. Indeed, in both popular and professional opinion, 
borderline individuals are notorious for just such distortions. But it is essen­
tial not to prejudge the opinions, thoughts, and decisions of a borderline pa-
--- Page 261 ---
242 BASIC TREATMENT STRATEGIES 
tient. When a therapist disagrees with a patient, it is all too easy simply to 
assume that the therapist is right and the patient is wrong. In looking for 
the "kernel of truth," the therapist takes a leap of faith and assumes that with 
proper scrutiny, some amount of validity or reason or sense can be found. 
Although the patient's grasp of reality may not be complete, neither is it wholly 
incomplete. At times, the patient's thoughts on the matter may make sub­
stantial sense. Borderline patients have an uncanny ability sometimes to see 
that the "emperor has no clothes"—to observe or attend to stimuli in the en­
vironment that others do not observe. The task of the therapist is to separate 
the wheat from the chaff and to focus, in this moment, on the wheat. 
4. ACKNOWLEDGING "WISE MIND" 
As I have discussed in Chapter 7, DBT presents to patients the concept of 
"wise mind," in contrast to "emotion mind" and "reasonable mind." "Wise 
mind" is the integration of both, and also includes an emphasis on intuitive, 
experiential, and/or spiritual ways of knowing. Thus, one aspea of cogni­
tive validation is the therapist's acknowledgment and support of this type of 
knowing on the part of the patient. The therapist takes the position that some­
thing can be valid even if the patient cannot prove it. The fact that someone 
else is more logical in an argument does not mean that the patient's points 
are not valid. Emotionality does not invalidate a position any more than logic 
can necessarily validate it. Each of these therapeutic positions counteracts 
aspects of the invalidating environment. 
5. RESPECTING DIFFERING VALUES 
At times a patient and therapist will have differing opinions and values. 
Respecting these differences, while not assuming superiority, is an essential 
component of cognitive validation. It is easy for a therapist to take a "one-
up" view of his or her own opinions and values as more respectable than the 
patient's, and thereby to invalidate the patient's point of view. For example, 
one of my patients believed that I should be avaUable to her by phone any 
time, night or day. She herself had a job in the mental health area and stated 
that she was available to the people she worked with, because she believed 
that it was the compassionate and right thing to do. I pointed out to her that 
the problem was that she was trying to get me to be like her (to have fewer 
limits on what I could give), and I was trying to get her to be more like me 
(to observe more limits). Although I did not change my position about my 
own behavior, I could appreciate the value of her point of view also. 
CHEERLEADING STRATEGIES 
In many ways, working with a borderiine patient is like being the football 
coach of the lowest-rated high school team in the league during the final game 
--- Page 262 ---
Core Strategies: Part I. Validation 243 
of the season. The team is behind 92 to 0 in the fourth quarter; three people 
are left in the stands. It is cold, snowing, and muddy, and the other team 
is threatening another touchdown. A time out is caUed by the team captain. 
The team huddles and wants to quit. What does the coach do? The coach 
acknowledges that the situation is grim, but nonetheless stands firm, shouts 
encouragement, and inspires the team to keep going. In short, the coach 
cheerleads. 
Borderline and suicidal patients are often discouraged, hopeless, and un­
able to see any nonsuicidal solution to their problems in living. Life and ther­
apy are very difficult for them. Their self-concept, and frequently the opinions 
others have of them as well, are at a low ebb. During a session, such a patient 
may vacillate between hope and discouragement. The most minor confronta­
tion may be enough to precipitate discouragement. Even when the patient 
is momentarily not discouraged, the therapist can be certain that between 
sessions the feeling is likely to return. Cheerleading strategies can be helpful 
both in counteracting current hopelessness and in anticipating and counter­
acting demoralizing episodes in the upcoming days. Cheerleading is one of 
the principal strategies for combating the aaive-passivity behavior of the bor­
derline patient. 
In cheerleading, the therapist is validating the inherent ability of the pa­
tient to overcome her difficulties and to build a life worth living. Although 
the form of that Hfe may differ from what is hoped or even expected at any 
given point, the potential for overcoming obstacles and for creating value is 
what is attended to and observed. The trick of cheerleading is to get the per­
son to perform up to her ability and to give her hope that her abilities can 
be expanded, while being realistic as to both what those abilities are and how 
much they can be expanded. A key therapist attitude is "I believe in you." 
At its very simplest, cheerleading is believing in the patient. For some pa­
tients, this will be their first experience of having someone believe in and have 
confidence in them. In cheerleading, the therapist is validating the inner capa­
bUities and wisdom of the patient; at times, therefore, the cheerleading strategy 
wUl balance, contrast, and contradict the emotional, behavioral, and cogni­
tive validating strategies. 
Cheerleading strategies are used in just about every interaaion (e.g., every 
session, every phone call). Frequency should be highest with the extremely 
dysfunctional patient. As the patient improves —and particularly during the 
last phase of therapy, which targets self-respect and self-validation —the 
amount of cheerleading should be tapered off. However, it is important to 
recognize that almost everyone needs a certain amount of cheerleading to get 
through life comfortably. This is particularly true when someone undertakes 
a difficult task, such as psychotherapy. Thus, although cheerleading should 
be reduced over the course of therapy, and certainly the focus of the cheer­
leading will change, it remains an important part of the therapeutic relation­
ship throughout. 
Cheerleading is sometimes experienced by the patient as invalidating. If 
--- Page 263 ---
244 BASIC TREATMENT STRATEGIES 
the therapist understood how really awful it is, and how really incapable the 
patient is, the therapist wouldn't believe that the patient can change or ac­
complish anything or do what is being requested. In cheerleading, the ther­
apist believes that the patient can save herself; the patient, in contrast, often 
believes that she needs to be saved. The task here is to balance an apprecia­
tion for the difficulties of making progress and reaHstic expeaations with hope 
and confidence that the patient can indeed change. Cheerleading has to be 
laced with emotional validation and a large dose of realism. Without these 
elements, it can indeed be invalidating. Thus, the therapist must be vigUant 
in recognizing the difficulty of the patient's problem, even while never giving 
up on the idea that the problem can be overcome eventually. The therpaist 
cheers the patient toward goals that are realistic for her, and considers in­
dividual differences in capabUities. Some specific techniques are discussed be­
low and summarized in Table 8.4. 
I. ASSUMING THE BEST 
One of the most demoralizing things that happens to borderline patients is 
that others attribute their lack of progress or ineffective behavior to an ab­
sence of motivation or to lack of effort. As discussed in Chapter 4, a fun­
damental assumption of DBT is that patients want to improve and are doing 
their best. Frequent comments to the patient that the therapist knows that 
she wants to improve, and that she is doing her best, are often helpful. These 
comments are most needed when the patient is expressing doubts about her 
desire to improve or reporting that she could have done better Almost al­
ways, the patient's statement that she could have done better should be fol­
lowed by a comment from the therapist that she did the best she could. Such 
a statement follows direaly from the behavioral validation strategies described 
above. 
Maintaining this belief—that the patient is doing the best she can —is 
both essential and extremely difficult. It often feels as if the patient is 
manipulating the therapist or is being obstinate. I find the following story 
useful for keeping myself and the therapists in my case consultation group 
in a cheerleading (rather than punishing) frame of mind: 
Imagine that you have just been in a terrible earthquake. Huge build­
ings have crashed down. Fires are all around. Police, firefighters and construc­
tion workers are overtaxed, and no one is available to help you. The child 
you love most in the world is still alive, but trapped in a small space under 
a building. There is a tiny opening she could crawl through to escape if she 
could get to it, or, if she could move just 2 feet closer to the opening, you 
could grab her and pull her out. The opening is too small for you to crawl 
in and get her Time is of the essence because a loudspeaker truck just went 
by telling everyone to clear the area; when the next aftershock comes, more 
of the building will fall down. You search for a stick or something to throw 
to her to grab hold of, with no success. The child is crying for help. She can't

doesn't move. Would you decide that she is manipulating you or just being

she wants to get out she will? Probably not. What would you do? Cheerlead. 
Cry out, command, yell, cajole, sweet-talk, insist, plead, suggest, threaten, 
direa, distract-all of these, in proper context and with proper modulation 
of tone, are methods of cheerleading. 
2. PROVIDING ENCOURAGEMENT 
Providing encouragement simply means expressing the belief that the patient 
wUl eventuaUy overcome her difficulties, will engage in requisite behaviors, 
will cope with a given situation, or the like. Essentially, it is a way of com-
--- Page 265 ---
246 BASIC TREATMENT STRATEGIES 
municating hope that the patient can achieve what she wishes to achieve. En­
couragement can be specific (e.g., "I know you can handle the upcoming job 
interview well") or general (e.g., "I know you will someday overcome your 
problems and make it in life"). It can express faith in the patient's abilities 
to cope or change in the short term (e.g., "I believe you can get through just 
this night without a drink") or in the long term (e.g., "I have confidence that 
someday you will overcome alcoholism"). However it is stated, it is absolute­
ly essential for the therapist not to give up hope in the patient, as well as 
to express that hope and confidence directly to the patient. 
One of the common mistakes both patients and therapists make is to 
underestimate the patients' avaUable ability and strength. Some therapists, 
like their patients, oscillate between underestimating and overestimating. It 
is important, however, that encouragement be based on clear assessment of 
a patient's abilities and not on the mood of a therapist. Generally, it is good 
to encourage the patient to do just a little more than she may be able to do 
with ease. That is, the therapist encourages the patient to do hard things. 
Believing that the patient can do something does not mean believing that it 
will be easy. Often, the patient will believe that she is not capable of doing 
it. In such a case, the therapist must balance cheerleading against validating 
the patient's sense of herself and her own abUities. The therapist must be adept 
at fading from "I think you can do it now" to "I think you can leam to do it." 
When the patient rejects encouragement, saying that the therapist does 
not understand, the therapist should consider whether he or she is are being 
too specific. In these instances, it can be helpful to faU back on the more general 
statement that the therapist simply believes in the patient, has confidence in 
her, or believes that somehow she will find a way It can also be useful to 
discuss with the patient the dilemma that she creates if she always feels mis­
understood if the therapist believes in her What is the therapist to do? Stop 
believing in her? 
3. FOCUSING ON THE PATIENT'S CAPABILITIES 
It is very easy to focus too closely on helping the patient gain insight into 
her maladaptive thinking patterns, problematic emotions, and dysfunctional 
action patterns. It is essential that the focus on problems be foUowed by a 
focus on and encouragement of the patient's capabilities. It is most helpfiil 
here to pinpoint specific capabUities specifically. 
Communicating That the Patient Has Everything She Needs to Succeed 
As noted in Chapter 3, borderline patients often subscribe to the "fatal flaw" 
theory: They believe that somehow they do not now and never wiU have what 
they need to overcome their difficulties. A therapist should periodically com­
municate that a patient has everything she needs to overcome her difficulties 
According to this perspeaive, the problem is a developmental one rather than 
--- Page 266 ---
Core Strategies: Part I. Validation 247 
a problem of critical and irremediable flaws. Thus, the strategy is to affirm 
the patient's inner strength, the presence of a "wise self," in a rather nonspecific 
way. Indeed, since the qualities alluded to are not direaly observable, the ther­
apist should not be trapped into trying to prove the validity of the affirma­
tion. Statements such as "I simply know it to be true" or "I simply feel it" 
may be sufficient. Since a borderline patient often feels that she has to prove 
the validity of any thought or emotion she experiences, such statements on 
the part of the therapist can also help to model for the patient the acceptabil­
ity of intuitive knowledge. When the patient argues with encouragement, the 
therapist can always fall back on this strategy. 
Expressing a Belief in the Therapeutic Relationship 
The therapist should periodically express a belief in the therapy team. This 
can be even more reassuring and encouraging to the patient than believing 
in the patient. If the patient believes in the therapist and the therapist be­
lieves in the patient, believing in the two as a team can be a good synthesis. 
Patients often doubt whether therapy can help them. Some, of course, cons­
tantly teU their therapists that; others keep their doubts to themselves. In either 
case, however, it is useful for a therapist to remark periodically that he or 
she has faith in the therapy and in the therapy team. Although the patient 
may often argue back, the power of this simple statement should not be un­
derestimated. 
Validating the Patient's Emotions, Behavior, and Thinking 
The strategies for emotional, behavioral, and cognitive validation discussed 
above can be quite appropriate in the context of cheerleading. 
4. CONTRADICTING/MODULATING EXTERNAL CRITICISM 
When the therapist is cheerleading the patient, the patient will often refer 
to other people's stated lack of belief in her or criticisms of her as justifica­
tion for her hopelessness and lack of self-belief. The therapist should point 
out that whether these criticisms are valid or not, they do not necessarUy im­
ply that the patient is hopeless. The therapist can (if honest) flatly disagree 
with the criticism. The therapist should not invalidate any negative feelings 
that the patient may be having in response to others' criticisms. Such emo­
tional responses are understandable, and this understanding should be com­
municated. 
5. PROVIDING PRAISE AND REASSURANCE 
Praising the patient's behavior can be both reinforcing and encouraging. The 
therapist should make a determined effort to find and highlight evidence of 
improvement. An area that can always be praised is the patient's steadfast-
--- Page 267 ---
248 BASIC TREATMENT STRATEGIES 
ness in working on her problem, as evidenced by her remaining in therapy. 
As I discuss extensively in the next chapter, a borderline patient often ex­
periences praise as threatening. Thus, for it to be an effeaive cheerleading 
technique, the therapist should surround it with reassurances. The content 
of the reassurance, of course, depends on the source of the threat. For exam­
ple, if praise threatens termination of help or therapy, the therapist may say, 
"I know you still need help." If praise threatens too high expectations in the 
future, the therapist may say "I know how difficult it still is." And so on. 
Some borderline patients seem to request reassurance endlessly. Ther­
apists often feel that no matter how often they reassure such patients, their 
reassurances fall on deaf ears; they have no effea. When this occurs, it should 
be treated as a therapy interfering behavior and addressed direaly. As I dis­
cuss further in Chapter 10, praise and reassurance should be graduaUy reduced 
as the patient learns to validate and soothe herself. This is, of course, espe­
cially important in Stage 3 (see Chapter 6) where self-respect is the primary 
target. 
6. BEING REALISTIC, BUT DEALING DIRECTLY 
WITH FEARS OF INSINCERITY 
A patient will sometimes respond to cheerleading with statements that she 
finds it hard to trust the therapist's sincerity. The first response to this should 
be to validate the lack of trust. The rules of therapy are so different from 
those of other relationships that the patient's uncertainty may well be under­
standable. At least, it may not be clear whether praise, encouragement, and 
cheerleading from a therapist have the same meaning as they do from some­
one else. After all, providing praise, encouragement and cheerleading is what 
the therapist is paid to do. Trust takes time to build; acknowledging that can 
be extremely validating for the patient. 
Second, it is essential that the therapist be realistic in her or his cheer­
leading. To make this point in my case consultation group, I add the follow­
ing to the story of the child in the earthquake (see above): 
Now, imagine the same earthquake situation. But add to it your knowledge that 
a huge boulder has fallen on the child, crushing her legs and hips, pinning her 
in the space where she is. Would you urge her to crawl, saying she can do it? 
No, you would soothe. You would console. You might search for more help, or 
you might stay near, no matter the danger to you. This is the balance that is 
needed with cheerleading. 
Effective cheerleading is contingent on realistic goals. It is not helpfiil 
for the therapist to tell the patient that she can do anything in a situation 
when in fact her chance of even minimal success is limited. Although a ther­
apist's faith in a patient's general ability to overcome difficulty may always 
be warranted, faith in her ability to achieve specific objeaives should be tem­
pered with a clear focus on reality. 
--- Page 268 ---
Core Strategies: Part I. Validation 249 
7. STAYING NEAR 
Cheerleaders and coaches do not leave a game early just because the team 
is doing weU. Similarly, it is important that the therapist be avaUable to offer 
coaching or other assistance if the patient runs into trouble. If the therapist 
tells a patient she can do something on her own, and then leaves her alone 
instead of standing in the wings, so to speak, it is understandable that the 
patient would suspea the therapist's motives in cheerleading. Since it is a habit 
of most busy people to "get rid" of others by telling them, "You don't need 
me," it is very important for the therapist to guard against inadvertently fall­
ing into this habit. 
Concluding Comments 
It is difficult to overestimate the importance of validation in DBT. Many 
problems in therapy are the result of insufficient validation and an excessive 
focus on change. The general rule to keep in mind is that every change strate­
gy must be surrounded by validation. Often the excessive focus on change 
stems froms the therapist's anxiety about helping the patient; the therapist, 
like the patient, is having problems tolerating the distress. Validation has many 
roles in DBT. It soothes the patient through very difficult times in therapy. 
Done well, it enhances the therapeutic connection of patient and therapist. 
The patient feels understood and supported. The therapist strengthens his 
or her own empathetic attitude. Therapist validation teaches the patient to 
trust and vaHdate herself. Finally, encourages the patient to keep going when 
she wants to throw in the towel.

Core Strategies: 
Part II. 
Problem Solving 
P _ roblem-solving strategies are the 
core DBT change strategies. In DBT, aU dysfunctional behaviors, in and out 
of sessions, are viewed as problems to be solved—or, from another perspec­
tive, as faulty solutions to problems in living. Problem-solving strategies with 
borderline patients are designed to foster an active approach that can coun­
teraa the passive, helpless response commonly encountered among this popu­
lation. 
Levels of Problem Solving 
First Level 
At the first level, the entire DBT program can be seen as a general applica­
tion of problem solving. The problem to be solved is a patient's overall life, 
and the solution is implementation of DBT. Problem-solving effeaiveness here 
depends on whether DBT is the appropriate treatment for this particular pa­
tient. To date, the empirical data suggest that the treatment is appropriate 
for severely impaired borderline women; it may or may not be appropriate 
for other groups. 
Second Level 
DBT is a very flexible treatment and includes many treatment strategies and 
procedures. The second level of problem solving is figuring out which strate­
gies and procedures should be applied to this specific patient, at this moment, 
250 
--- Page 270 ---
Core Strategies: Part II. Problem Solving 251 
for this problem. Most importantiy, the therapist has to figure out which 
change strategies are most Hkely to be helpful. Problem-solving effectiveness 
here depends on whether the therapist correctly determines what is causing 
and maintaining the problem behaviors in need of change. Application of 
a specific change procedure is the problem solution at this level. The four 
main change procedures used in DBT (contingency management, skills train­
ing, cognitive modification, and exposure) are described in the next two 
chapters. 
Third Level 
At the third level, problem solving addresses specific problems that come up 
in the patient's day-to-day life. A DBT treatment session often begins with 
the patient's describing events that have occurred during the past week. This 
description may take place in the context of reviewing diary cards and respond­
ing to questions about suicide ideation or parasuicide during the previous 
week. During the initial stages of this discussion, the patient may describe 
situations involving emotions, thoughts, or aaions that she felt unable to con­
trol. Or she may have reaaed to her problems with suicidal or other dysfunc­
tional behaviors. If the problem is ongoing, she may present a plan of action 
(suicidal or nonsuicidal) that she intends to pursue but that the therapist be­
lieves is either impulsive or likely to be dysfunctional. 
Usually, the patient's problem is not as clearly articulated as the preced­
ing statements might suggest. Sometimes the problem must be "dragged out" 
of the patient, so to speak, especially when the patient feels she has already 
solved the problem and wants to move on to a new problem. (This is espe­
cially likely, for example, when the patient has "solved" her problem via 
parasuicidal behavior.) At other times, the patient's problems wUl be presented 
in the context of emotional ventilation, involving anger, desperation, anxie­
ty, or tearful depression. In either of these instances, the task of the therapist 
is to elicit a collaborative effort from the patient in developing and implement­
ing new, more effeaive solutions to her current problems in life. Problem-
solving effectiveness here depends on whether the therapist and patient can 
generate a solution to the specific problem the patient brings in, and whether 
the patient can or will carry out the solution. 
Mood and Problem Solving 
The effect of mood on problem solving is essential to understand in working 
with borderline patients. As I have noted repeatedly in this book, borderline 
patients are characterized by volatUe mood swings. A baseline negative mood 
is most typical for chronically suicidal borderline patients, but all are sensi­
tive to any mood-relevant therapeutic behaviors. Thus, a negative mood can 
at times be improved and a positive mood can be ruined by incidental or in­
advertent therapist responses. 
--- Page 271 ---
252 BASIC TREATMENT STRATEGIES 
Problem solving, cognitive flexibility, and mood are inextricably linked. 
Flexibility is related to the ability to actively choose cognitive strategies that 
fit one's goals at a particular time, to adapt to one's environment, and to find 
creative yet relevant solutions to problems (Berg & Sternberg, 1985; Showers 
& Cantor, 1985; Simon, 1990). The ability to analyze problems (particular­
ly aspects of one's own behavior and one's environment that are related to 
the problem) and to generate effective solutions, therefore, requires a certain 
amount of cognitive flexibility. A number of research studies suggest strong­
ly that positive mood facilitates cognitive flexibility, and thus problem solv­
ing in general. 
Positive mood enhances a person's ability to develop multiple, alterna­
tive interpretations of a situation and to see interconnections or similarities 
when required by a task, as well as to see important distinaions when that 
is required (Murray, Sujan, Hirt, & Sujan, 1990; Showers & Cantor, 1985). 
These abilities in turn are requisite to collaborating with the therapist in 
analyzing and interpreting behavioral patterns. Positive mood also enhances 
creativity, including generation of problem solutions (Isen, Daubman, & 
Nowicki, 1987; Isen, Johnson, Mertz, & Robins, 1985). When asked to gener­
ate solutions to problems, individuals in a positive mood, relative to others, 
may organize fnformation differently, see relationships they would not or­
dinarily see, and use more creative and intuitive cognitive strategies (Fiedler, 
1988). Evaluating the outcomes associated with particular solutions is also 
affeaed by mood. For example, subjective estimates of risk and the likeli­
hood of positive versus negative outcomes are related to an individual's cur­
rent positive or negative mood (see Williams, 1993, for a review of this 
literature). 
These points are essential to keep in mind when applying problem solv­
ing with borderline patients. In particular, the therapist should expect that 
problem solving will often go more slowly and be more difficult than with 
many other patient populations. The need for sympathetic understanding and 
for interventions aimed at enhancing current positive mood during problem 
solving can be extremely important. The effectiveness of validation strategies 
may result in part from their mood-enhancing effects. Understanding these 
points and mentally rehearsing them while interacting with the patient may 
also be helpful in heading off inappropriate interpretations of the patient's 
passive problem solving or negative attitudes toward proposed solutions as 
simply not trying or not wanting to change. 
A primary task of the therapist is to orient the patient to seeing maladap­
tive behavior as in fact a result of attempting to solve problems in living. With 
help, these problems can be solved in a more functional and adaptive fashion. 
The six groups of problem-focused strategies discussed in this chapter-
behavioral analysis, insight strategies, didactic strategies, solution analysis, 
orienting strategies, and commitment strategies —may be repeated as new 
problems are brought up for discussion. In some cases, the sequence will be 
modified and/or several sections will need to be repeated (seemingly over and

over) in dealing with a single problem issue. The application of problem-
solving strategies to the more general case of selecting DBT as the treatment 
for a particular patient is discussed more extensively in Chapter 14. 
Overview of Problem-Solving Strategies 
Problem solving is a two-stage process: (1) understanding and accepting the 
problem at hand, and (2) attempting to generate, evaluate, and implement 
alternative solutions that might have been used or could be used in the future 
in similar problematic situations. The acceptance stage employs behavioral 
analysis, insight strategies, and didactic strategies; the second stage, that of 
targeting change, employs solution analysis, orienting strategies, and com­
mitment strategies. 
Although it may seem obvious, solving problems requires first accepting 
of the existence of a problem. As noted earlier, therapeutic change can only 
occur within the context of acceptance of what is. In the case of borderline 
patients, problem solving is enormously complicated by their frequent ten­
dency to view themselves negatively and their inability to regulate the conse­
quent emotional distress. On the one pole, they have difficulty correctly 
identifying problems in their environment, tending instead to view aU problems 
as somehow self-generated. On the other pole, viewing all problems as self-
generated is so painful that the patients often respond by inhibiting the process 
of self-reflection. Repeated attempts to address both the failures in dialecti­
cal thinking that have led to these positions and the accompanying negative 
emotions may be necessary before the patients can acknowledge the existence 
of the more painful problems. The validation strategies described in Chapter 
8, and the irreverent communication strategies, described in Chapter 12, aid 
this process without reinforcing suicidal or other extreme behaviors. 
Behavioral analysis requires a chain analysis of the events and situation­
al factors leading up to and following the particular problematic response 
at hand. The analysis is conducted in great detail, with close attention to the 
reciprocal interaction between the environment and the patient's cognitive, 
emotional, and behavioral responses. Insight strategies, which are pulled apart 
from behavioral analysis arbitrarily for the purposes of the present discus­
sion, include observing and labeling patterns of behavior and situational in­
fluence over time. The analysis of the problem proceeds in a nonjudgmental 
fashion, with attention to the patient's tendency both to experience panic and 
to engage in ruthless, vindictive evaluative judgments whenever behaviors or 
behavioral outcomes are less than expeaed or desired. Typically, the target 
of these judgments shifts, sometimes with lightning speed, from the self as 
generating the problem to other people or the environment as the sole source 
of the problem. Throughout, the therapist provides information to the pa­
tient in a didactic fashion about characteristics of behavior and people in 
general, and of borderline behavior in particular This information both nor-
--- Page 273 ---
254 BASIC TREATMENT STRATEGIES 
malizes the patient's own behavior and serves as a source of hypotheses about 
what may be maintaining the patient's behavior, as well as what may help 
in the change process. 
The second problem-solving stage begins with the generation and evalu­
ation of alternative solutions that can be used in the future. Once a range 
of solutions has been generated, the therapist and patient review what is re­
quired to implement the change procedures. That is, the therapist orients the 
patient to the change process. Finally, the therapist and patient commit them­
selves to the implementation of the solutions generated. Putting commitment 
at the end of problem solving is done purely for illustrative purposes; in real­
ity, it precedes, accompanies, and follows change procedures. 
BEHAVIORAL ANALYSIS STRATEGIES 
Behavioral analysis is one of the most important and most difficult sets of 
strategies in DBT. Many, if not most, therapeutic errors are assessment er­
rors; that is, they are therapeutic responses based on a faulty understanding 
and assessment of the problem at hand. Behavioral analysis is the first step 
in problem solving. Treatment of any new patient, or of any new problem 
behavior with a current patient, requires an adequate behavioral analysis to 
guide the seleaion of an appropriate intervention. In addition, the emergence 
(or omission) of currently targeted problem behaviors between one session 
and the next, as well as failures in self-control programs (e.g., attempts to 
increase positive behaviors, and decrease negative behaviors) or problems aris­
ing within the therapy process itself, should be responded to first with a be­
havioral analysis. 
The purpose of a behavioral analysis is to figure out what the problem 
is, what is causing it, what is interfering with the resolution of the problem, 
and what aids are available to help solve the problem. In some instances, some 
of this information is already known or can be surmised. Thus, the process 
of conducting a behavioral analysis may be brief, involving only a few ques­
tions, or quite lengthy, requiring one or more entire therapy sessions. The 
point in either case, however, is to check out in an empirical fashion what 
the therapist is either surmising from experience with the particular patient 
or hypothesizing from theory; in a way, it is a counterpoint to therapist bias. 
Thus, it should not be dispensed with or run through in a cavalier fashion. 
The only exceptions are cases when intervention, even without an assessment, 
is urgent; when other activities cleariy take priority; or when the therapist 
is very sure of his or her assessment of the situation. 
As noted earlier, behavioral analysis is presented separately from insight 
strategies in this chapter for purely instruaional purposes. In reality, behavioral 
analysis will always include insight strategies; in turn, insight into a patient's 
problems and behavioral patterns depends on the judicious use of behavioral 
analysis. In most textbooks on behavioral assessment, the two sets of strate­
gies are combined, with the whole being labeled "behavioral analysis" or "func-
--- Page 274 ---
Core Strategies: Part II. Problem Solving 255 
tional analysis." For our purposes, the two sets of strategies can be separated 
as foUows. Behavioral analysis in DBT refers specifically to the in-depth anal­
ysis of one particular instance or set of instances of a problem or a targeted 
behavior Thus it is a self-conscious and focused attempt on the part of the 
therapist (and, one hopes, the patient) to determine the factors leading 
up to, following, and "controUing" or influencing the behavior Therapeutic 
insight is the feedback the therapist gives the patient about patterns of be­
havior that have emerged either within the relationship, during session-to-
session discussion, or over the course of a number of separate behavioral 
analyses. 
Three aspects of the behavioral analysis process are critical: (1) The anal­
ysis must be carried out collaboratively (this necessitates the concurrent use 
of other strategies, such as validation and contingency management); (2) it 
must provide sufficient detail to give an accurate and reasonably complete 
piaure of the sequence of internal and external events associated with the 
problem behavior; and (3) conclusions must be accepted in a manner that 
will permit their abandonment if they are later disconfirmed. The ultimate 
goal is to teach the patient to perform a competent behavioral analysis on 
her own. Behavioral analysis includes a number of steps, which are discussed 
below and summarized in Table 9.1. 
There are any number of ways to divide up the conduct of such as anal­
ysis. Not every aspect of the steps discussed below is always required, and 
the order is not invariant. But the therapist should, at a minimum, obtain 
all of the indicated information. 
I. DEFINING THE PROBLEM BEHAVIOR 
Choosing a Focus 
The focus of problem definition is determined by a number of factors. At 
the first level (see "Levels of Problem Solving," above), when therapy is begin­
ning or when its targets or goals are shifting, the target priority list (see Chapter 
6, Table 6.1) is used as a guideline. Problems are explored in all seven of the 
specified areas: suicidal behaviors, therapy-interfering behaviors, behaviors 
that interfere with quality of life, behavioral skills deficits, posttraumatic stress 
responses, problems with self-respea, and difficulties in achieving individual 
goals. At the second level, when therapy is in progress, the focus of assess­
ment is determined by the order of targets within the DBT hierarchy. Thus, 
during the first phase of therapy, any suicidal, therapy-interfering, or quality-
of-life-interfering behaviors that have occurred since the last session are ad­
dressed explicitiy (in that order of priority, although not necessarily that order 
in time). During the second phase of therapy, posttraumatic stress responses 
are probed and analyzed. During the final phase of therapy, failures in self-
respea and in meeting individual goals are observed and responded to. At 
the third level, if no prioritized problem behaviors have occurred, the patient 
sets the agenda and focus.

This process of arriving at a problem to be analyzed differs from the 
behavioral case formulation method of Turkat (1990) in that the highest-
priority targets are not so much those "primary" problems that may be seen 
as giving rise to all other symptoms, but those problems that embody the 
gravest immediate threat to continued life, therapy, and minimal quaHty of 
life, in that order From the DBT point of view, assessment of any problem 
will soon lead to the "primary" problem through the interrelationships be­
tween behavioral systems and across problems that emerge through repeated 
behavioral analyses. Arrival at these primary problems is dependent on con­
duct of very thorough chain analyses, as described later 
Formulating the Problem in Terms of Behavior 
Although at times the problem to be solved is the environment's behavior, 
not the patient's, the therapeutic task is to formulate the problem in terms 
--- Page 276 ---
Core Strategies: Part II. Problem Solving 257 
of some aspect of the patient's or therapist's feelings, thoughts, or actions. 
For example, with a patient in a severely abusive marriage the problem may 
be cast as the patient's not finding the situation acceptable. The eventual so­
lution may then be to leave the partner or act in a way that causes the partner 
to either stop the abuse or be controlled by others. By defining the patient's 
behavior of not leaving the partner or not acting to change the partner's abu­
sive interaction as the problem, I am not suggesting that the environment is 
not dysfunctional, maladaptive, and aversive. Nonetheless, a defining charac­
teristic of all psychotherapy with adults, including DBT, is that the primary 
focus is on the patient's behavior in situations, not on the situations themselves. 
As I have noted previously, a borderline patient often presents a solution 
to a problem (e.g., "I'm going to kill myself) without being able to identify 
the problem. The patient may present extremely painful emotions or discuss 
aversive environmental situations without being able to label such events as 
problem situations to be solved. At other times, the patient will describe a 
situation or event in such ambiguous and nonspecific terms that it is difficult 
to isolate the problem with any precision. In either case, the therapist should 
tell the patient that the first task is to identify the specific problem clearly 
and in terms of behavior At times, the patient will be unwilling to engage 
in such a discussion; in these instances, the therapist should simply repeated­
ly formulate for the patient what the problem behavior appears to be. As noted 
in Chapter 8, however, it is critical for the therapist not to assume automati­
caUy that the problem is the patient's distortion of a situation rather than 
the aversiveness of a situation itself. 
Describing the Problem Specifically 
Problem definition should be specific, not general. Defining a problem as "feel­
ing upset and blue every day" is general. Saying the problem is "feeling de­
pressed every day" is more specific but still too general. The goal is to describe 
precisely and in detail exactly what the individual means by "depression" and 
by "every day." Thus, once the problem behavior pattem is identified in general, 
the therapist should obtain a precise description of the behavior in terms of its 
topography (i.e., exactiy what the patient did), the frequency of its occurrence 
since the last session, and its intensity (i.e., strength or depth of the behavior). 
Some examples of useful questions for eliciting specific descriptions are 
as follows: "What do you mean by that, exactiy?" "How many times did that 
happen last week?" "How long [how many minutes] did that feeling stay with 
you?" "Did a thought run through your mind at that point? What was it?" 
"How intense was the feeling or desire on a 1-100 scale?" Although after a 
few behavior analyses the therapist and patient may not need such detailed 
questioning, the therapist must nonetheless be very careful not to assume that 
things are clear when they have not been made clear The assumption of faas 
not in evidence seems to be one of the most common mistakes people make 
when learning how to do behavior analysis. 
--- Page 277 ---
258 BASIC TREATMENT STRATEGIES 
Specific therapeutic strategies for obtaining this information and arriv­
ing at a definition of the problem include the validation strategies of active 
observing, reflection, helping the patient observe and label emotions reading 
emotions, asking multiple-choice emotion questions, eliciting noninferential 
and nonjudgmental descriptions of behavior, eliciting and reflecting the pa­
tient's thoughts, and assessing the facts (see Chapter 8). 
Validating the Patient's Distress 
It is difficult to focus on solving a problem if one has not first accepted the 
validity of having the problem in the first place. As noted in Chapter 8, bor­
derline and suicidal individuals quite often have difficulty experiencing and 
admitting to having painful emotions or needing help. Thus, validating strate­
gies must be interwoven with all of the assessment strategies. 
2. CONDUCTING A CHAIN ANALYSIS 
Choosing a Specific Instance of Behavior to Analyze. 
Once the problem behavior is identified, the next task is to develop an ex­
haustive, step-by-step description of the chain of events leading up to and 
following the behavior At the first level, when therapy is beginning, the ther­
apist will need to mix more general analyses of the overall pattern of problem 
behaviors, their antecedents, and their consequences with more detaUed ana­
lyses of some specific instances. Chapter 14 describes how to do this. 
At the second level, chain analyses will focus on any instances of DBT 
target behaviors that have occurred since the last session or that are ongoing 
in the current therapeutic interaction. The important point here is that 
although the therapist should get an overview each session of how often a 
particular problem behavior occurred, a chain analysis requires that one in­
stance of the behavior be selected. This point cannot be overstressed. The 
essence of conducting a chain analysis is examining a particular instance of 
a specific dysfunctional behavior in excruciating detail. Much of the ther­
apeutic work in DBT is the ceaseless analysis of specific instances of targeted 
behaviors, each time integrating new information with old information to 
evolve a definition of patterns and to explore possible new behavioral solu­
tions to continuing problem events. 
Why such an emphasis on detailed assessment of individual episodes? 
It is because the therapist does not rely on the patient's unaided ability to 
remember, analyze, select important antecedents and consequences, and syn­
thesize information across a number of episodes. That is, the therapist does 
not assume that the patient comes to therapy with good behavioral analysis 
skills already in place. When a targeted behavior or problem sftuation has 
occurred more than once during the preceding week or is currently evident 
in the session, a number of faaors can influence which one is chosen for anal-
--- Page 278 ---
Core Strategies: Part II. Problem Solving 259 
ysis. How severe or intense the instance was, how well remembered it is, how 
important it was in setting off other events, and the patient's own preference 
are all important. When severity and priority are equivalent, the therapist 
should select behaviors occurring within the session over those occuring be­
tween sessions for analysis. Over time and repeated analyses, a sample of be­
havioral instances will be chosen that represents the entire class of events. 
At the third level, if no DBT high-priority behaviors are relevant for anal­
ysis or a crisis situation has developed demanding attention, the focus of the 
analysis is determined by the patient as noted earlier 
Attending to the Links of the Chain 
Where to Start? Since maladaptive behavior is viewed as a solution to 
a problem, a good way to figure out the beginning of the chain is to ask the 
patient when the problem began. Maladaptive behavior is viewed as occur­
ring within a context or an episode that for the purposes of analysis has a 
beginning, a middle (the behavior in question), and an end. In my experience, 
a patient can usually pinpoint, at least roughly, when that episode began. 
The idea, however, is to locate in the environment the event that precipitated 
the patient's chain of behavior Although precipitating events may at times 
be difficult to pinpoint, this task is very important. The overall goal is to link 
the patient's behavior to environmental events, especially ones that she may 
not realize are having an effect on her behavior. For example, the patient may 
simply have woken up feeling hopeless and suicidal, or she may not be able 
to identify anything in the environment that set off a series of worries. 
Nonetheless, the therapist should get a good description of events co-occurring 
with the onset of the problem, even if these events at first appear unrelated 
to the patient's behavior. Rather than asking "What caused that?", the ther­
apist should ask "What set that off?" or "What was going on at the moment 
the problem started?" Therapists not trained in behavioral therapies, as well 
as patients, may be tempted to give up this search too easily. With persistence 
and the passage of time, however, a pattern of events associated with problem 
initiation may emerge. 
Filling in the Links. The key here is that the therapist has to think in 
terms of very small units of behavior—the links in the chain, so to speak. 
A common problem is that many therapists assume they understand the link 
between one behavioral response and the next, and thus fail to identify many 
links in the chain that may turn out to be important. Once the therapist and 
patient identify the start of the chain, the therapist should get very detailed 
information about what was going on both in the environment and behavioral­
ly with the patient at that point. By "behaviorally," I mean what the patient 
was doing, feeling (emotions and sensations), thinking (both explicitly and 
impHcitly, as in expectations and assumptions), and imagining. 
Once one link is described, the therapist should ask, "What next?" Be-
--- Page 279 ---
260 BASIC TREATMENT STRATEGIES 
havioral and environmental events should be described for each link in the 
chain. Both patient and therapist may be inclined at times to jump over a 
number of links. To fill in links, the therapist can ask questions of the "How 
did you get from here to there?" type —for example, "How did you get from 
feeling like you wanted to talk to me to calling me on the phone?" When one 
patient and I were analyzing a suicide attempt, the patient told me that be­
fore she attempted suicide she decided to kill herself. I asked what had led 
up to this decision. She said that it was her feeling that life was too painful 
to live any longer From the patient's point of view, the link between feeling 
that life was unendurable and deciding to kill herself was self-evident, but 
it was not to me. Indeed, it seemed to me that one could decide life was too 
painful to live any longer and then decide to change life. Or one could 
believe that death would be even more painful and decide to tolerate life des­
pite its pain. As it turned out upon questioning, the patient actually assumed 
that she would be happier dead than alive. Challenging this assumption 
then became one of the solutions to stopping her persistent attempts at 
suicide. 
The strategy here is almost exactly the opposite of the validation strate­
gy of reading the patient's emotions, behavior, or mind, described in Chap­
ter 8. Rather than understanding the links in the chain, the therapist must 
play the role of naive observer, understanding nothing and questioning every­
thing. This is not to suggest that figuring out the links in the chain indepen­
dently of the patient is never helpful. It can be when the patient skips over 
parts of the chain of events. At these points, the therapist can question whether 
a particular event, thought, or feeling might not be an important link. 
The goals here are several. First, the therapist wants to identify events 
that may automatically elicit maladaptive behaviors or are precursors to them. 
Emotional responses in particular, but also other behaviors, may be controlled 
primarily through their conditioned associations with events. Second, the ther­
apist wants to identify behavioral deficits that may have set up the problematic 
responses. If parasuicide is a "cry for help," it may be that alternative help-
seeking behaviors are unavailable to the person. Third, the therapist wants 
to pinpoint events, either in the environment or in the person's prior responses 
(fears, beliefs, incompatible behaviors), that might have interfered with more 
appropriate behaviors. Finally, the therapist wants to get a general idea of 
how the person arrives at dysfunctional responses, as well as of possible al­
ternative paths she could have taken. 
Where to Stop? A chain analysis requires information concerning events 
that led up to the problem behavior (antecedents), as weU as information about 
the consequences of the behavior The most important consequences are those 
that may be influencing the problem behavior by maintaining, strengthen­
ing, or increasing it (reinforcers). These may include the occurrence of prefer­
able events, the nonoccurrence or cessation of aversive events, or opportunities 
to engage in preferable behaviors. Similarly, the therapist wants to identify 
--- Page 280 ---
Core Strategies: Part II. Problem Solving 261 
consequences that may be important in weakening or decreasing the problem 
behavior 
As with events preceding the behavior, the therapist should obtain in­
formation about external events (the effects of the behavior on the external 
context or relationships) as well as internal events (emotions, somatic sensa­
tions, actions, images, thoughts, assumptions, and expectations). It is impor­
tant to get information both about the events that occur and about their 
valence or attraction to the patient. The therapist needs some knowledge of 
rudimentary principles of reinforcement. For example, immediate effects are 
more likely to influence behavior over effects that are temporally distant from 
the behavior. Intermittent reinforcement can be a powerful method of mak­
ing a behavior very resistant to extinaion. Punishment will suppress behavior, 
but if another potentiaUy reinforcing response is not available, the behavior 
will typicaUy reappear once the punishment is removed. 
The goal here is to ascertain the function of the behavior, or, in other 
words, to determine what problem the behavior has solved. A most impor­
tant point to keep in mind is that the patient may not be aware of what func­
tion the behavior has, nor of which of many consequences are important in 
maintaining the behavior This is true of most behavior for most people; most 
behavioral learning occurs outside of awareness. (Or, from another point of 
view, most learning is implicit rather than explicit.) It is equally important 
to keep in mind that saying that consequences maintain behavior is not the 
same thing as saying that an individual does something "in order to" get the 
consequences. For example, students can influence where a professor stands 
in a classroom or what he or she says, simply by nodding and smiling when 
the professor moves in the targeted direction or makes certain comments. In­
evitably, this effect occurs without the professor's awareness. Does this mean 
that the professor changes his or her behavior in order to get the nods or 
smiles of the students? A computer can be programmed to vary its "behavior," 
depending on consequences; does this mean that the computer acts in order 
to get certain consequences? Yet it is this very imputation of "in order to" 
that often gets in the way of patients' wUlingness to explore the effeas of con­
sequences on their behavior—primarily because the "in order to" is often in­
ferred, is inaccurate, is not in accord with their phenomenological experiences, 
and imputes pejorative motives. Explaining these points, as I indicate later 
in the discussion of didaaic strategies, is a very important part of the therapy. 
Conducting Brief Chain Analyses of In-Session Behaviors 
When currentiy targeted behaviors occur within a therapy session, they should 
be analyzed immediately. When the focus is on an in-session behavior, however, 
a chain analysis will often be shortened, consisting of perhaps only a few 
questions. For example, if the patient threatens suicide, the therapist might 
stop and ask several questions to determine what led up to the threat, com­
ment on other alternative responses the patient could have made at each point. 
--- Page 281 ---
262 BASIC TREATMENT STRATEGIES 
and then retum to the previous discussion topic. Such a digression may take 
only a few minutes, but can have very powerful effeas if done consistently. 
This technique blends conceptually with insight strategies (see below). 
Maintaining Cooperation 
Getting the patient to cooperate with chain analyses is one of the essential 
tasks of therapy. In my experience, both therapists and patients often resist 
this work. Patients have any number of reasons for avoiding it. First, it in­
volves a great deal of effort, often when they are exhausted, want nurturing, 
or have settled into aaive-passivity responding. Analyzing past dysfunction­
al behavior also commonly elicits intensely painful shame. Furthermore, it 
interferes with patients' current interpretations of their behavior-
interpretations that the patients may be motivated to hold on to. Finally, since 
the behavior is past, patients often want to forget it and attend to the crises 
of the moment. Even when old problems are attended to, patients want to 
focus on the situation (which can be either the environment, their own be­
havior, or a blend of the two) that set off the chain rather than on their 
maladaptive solutions. Therapists must remember that much of the time, dys­
functional behaviors are viewed as problems by therapists but as solutions 
by patients. Reminding patients of the problematic aspects of their behaviors 
and their commitment to work on these behaviors may be necessary, some­
times over and over. 
Therapists also may prefer to avoid these analyses. As for the patients, 
they involve a lot of aaive work. It is often easier and frequently more in­
teresting just to sit and listen to the patients talk. For many therapists, it is 
difficult to direct patients or to get them to do things in therapy they don't 
want to do. Some are afraid that if they make the patients go through chain 
analyses, the patients may get suicidal. Or the intense resistance and hostility 
direaed at the therapists are simply too aversive. In my experience, the ten­
dency to avoid behavioral analysis in general and chain analysis in particular 
is one of the major impediments to conducting DBT. The most helpful anti­
dote is the case consultation team. 
Using Previous Analyses to Guide the Current Analysis 
After a number of chain analyses of a particular behavior pattern, the ther­
apist should work collaboratively with the patient to generate several 
hypotheses about usual or typical controlling variables. These hypotheses may 
relate to the situations in which the problem behavior occurs; other behaviors 
(thoughts, feelings, sensations, and overt actions) that ordinarily lead to the 
problem behavior; reinforcers that may be maintaining the problem behavior; 
beliefs and expectancies about the utility of the problem behavior; and so 
on. The therapist and patient should discuss and generate these hypotheses 
together Hypotheses formulated should, in turn, guide the information ex-
--- Page 282 ---
Core Strategies: Part II. Problem Solving 263 
plored during the next chain analysis. That is, once a hypothesis is formed, 
subsequent chain analyses can be used to test its validity. In this manner, the 
information searched for becomes more fine-tuned over time. 
Helping the Patient to Monitor Her Behavior 
As noted eariier in this chapter, there is ample experimental evidence to 
demonstrate that current mood can have a powerful effect on memory and 
on how information is organized, retrieved, and processed (Williams, 1993). 
This is a particular problem in tteating borderiine patients, since variable mood 
and affect regulation is a defining characteristic of the population. In DBT, 
emphasis is given not only to behaviors occurring within the treatment ses­
sion, but also to behaviors and events occurring since the last session. In order 
to assess and treat these behaviors properly, more or less accurate informa­
tion is essential. 
Reliance on unaided memory is the least acceptable way of obtaining 
information. Thus, in DBT, as in most types of behavior therapy, there is an 
emphasis on having patients monitor their own behavior on a daily basis. 
Use of the diary cards described in Chapter 6 is an essential component of 
DBT, at least during the first two phases of therapy, where very specific be­
haviors are targeted. These cards provide a record of frequency and intensity 
of problem behaviors during the interval between individual sessions. They 
do not, however, record information about events surrounding the problem 
behaviors. Thus, these cards are best used as signals of problems that need 
tracking and assessment. 
Whether a patient should be requested to keep more detaUed diary records 
depends on the patient's ability to remember events, the current phase of 
problem assessment, and the patient's ability and wUlingness to monitor be­
havior in writing. Some patients are quite good at verbally reconstructing 
events surrounding problem behaviors. Although a week or two of daUy 
monitoring might be a good idea to check the validity of these patients' recall, 
ongoing daUy monitoring is often not needed. Other patients seem to have 
great difficulty recalling the specific details surrounding stressful behaviors. 
In-session chain analyses of behavior with these patients can be quite helpful 
in teaching them how to organize and recall events. In my experience, after 
a number of such analyses, most patients improve in their ability to attend 
to, organize, and recall specific details of both problem behaviors and the 
events surrounding them. There is some evidence to suggest that this improve­
ment in specific recall ability may be one of the therapeutic mechanisms of 
DBT (WiUiams, 1991). 
In a comprehensive behavioral log, the therapist should include space 
for recording a brief description of the problem behavior; the date, duration, 
and frequency of the behavior, the place or context of the behavior (where 
and who with); thoughts, feelings, and other behaviors preceding the problem 
behavior (antecedents); and what happened afterwards (consequences). De-
--- Page 283 ---
264 BASIC TREATMENT STRATEGIES 
pending on the task, one or more of these categories may be dropped or col­
lapsed into another The use of such a log provides an opportunity for the 
therapist to help the patient learn to observe and describe the who, what, 
when, where, and how of events; to discriminate inferences from observa­
tions; and to structure and organize recall to maximum benefit of behavior 
change. 
When daily monitoring is used, therapist and patient should collaborate 
on the form of the monitoring system. The importance of this cannot be over­
emphasized. Patients almost always have definite opinions and preferences 
about how to structure this task; it is pointless and unnecessary to impose 
a particular format on them. 
Some patients love to keep diaries, and will arrive at each session with 
copious notes and records of the preceding week or will send daily diaries 
through the mail. With these patients, the task usually is to structure their 
record keeping so that data can be easily and quickly extraaed and organized. 
Other patients are very unwilling or are actually unable to do comprehensive 
daily monitoring. Although fiUing out DBT diary cards is required (and so 
far I have never had a patient who was unable to fill out a card), other monitor­
ing should be at the discretion of each therapist and patient. Dyslexic pa­
tients, for example, often have great difficulty with any writing task. Other 
patients report that their problems interfere with their ability to focus on a 
monitoring task. 
Whether a refusal or inability to undertake self-monitoring is viewed as 
therapy-interfering behavior depends on the importance of the information 
to the conduct of the therapy. For example, if cognitive modification proce­
dures are being used to change ongoing or frequent thoughts and assump­
tions, it is next to impossible for a patient to recall accurately and specifically 
during a therapy session her sequence of thoughts during the previous week, 
or the way in which these thoughts were related to problem behaviors. Daily 
monitoring here may be essential, and the therapist should be very careful 
not to drop it just because the patient does not want to do it or finds it difficult. 
At other times, monitoring may be useful but is not really essential. For ex­
ample, in my experience, most patients can (with help) learn to remember 
reasonably accurately the events leading up to, surrounding, and following 
parasuicidal behavior A therapist should not insist on monitoring just be­
cause it seems like a good idea. 
3. GENERATING HYPOTHESES ABOUT 
FACTORS CONTROLLING BEHAVIOR 
Using Theory to Guide Analysis 
DBT assumes that each individual has a unique pattern of variables control­
ling her "borderline" behaviors, and, in addition, that the variables control­
ling behavior in one instance may be different from those guiding it in another 
--- Page 284 ---
Core Strategies: Part II. Problem Solving 265 
Also, as noted in Chapter 2, DBT does not assume that any particular be­
havioral system, such as aaions, cognitions, physiological/biological re­
sponses, or sensory responses, is intrinsically more important than another 
in the elicitation or maintenance of problematic behavior In this sense, DBT 
is based on neither pure cognitive nor pure behavioral theory. Although refer­
ence is always made to the environmental context of behavior, DBT assumes 
that proximal causes of behavior may be behavioral or environmental, de­
pending on the specific instance. 
This does not mean, however, that DBT has no theoretical preferences; 
it does, and they are very important. With respect to antecedent or eliciting 
variables, DBT focuses most closely on intense or aversive emotional states. 
Maladaptive behavior, to a large extent, is viewed as resulting from emotion 
dysregulation. The amelioration of unendurable emotional pain is always sus­
pected as one of the primary motivational factors in borderline dysfunction­
al behavior Thus, in any chain analysis antecedent emotional behaviors should 
be explored in particular depth. DBT also suggests typical patterns or chains 
of events that are likely to lead to these aversive emotional states. That is, 
DBT suggests various sets of environmental events and patient behaviors that 
are probably instrumental in producing and maintaining borderline behaviors. 
Behavioral deficits in dialectical thinking and the ability to synthesize polari­
ties, as well as deficits in the behavioral skills of mindfulness, interpersonal 
effeaiveness (especially in conflia resolution), affea regulation, distress toler­
ance, and self-management, are theoretically important to assess. 
From a somewhat different perspeaive, DBT suggests that particular sets 
of extreme behavior patterns are also likely both to be instrumental in the 
generation and maintenance of borderline behavior, and with the process of 
change. These patterns include deficits in emotional modulation, self-
validation, realistic reasoning and judgment, emotional experiencing, aaive 
problem solving, and accurate expressions of emotional states and compe­
tence. Corresponding to these deficits, and usually co-occurring with them, 
are excesses in emotional reaaivity, self-invalidation, crisis-generating be­
haviors, grief inhibition, active-passivity behaviors, and mood dependency. 
These patterns and their relationship to BPD and therapy are discussed ex­
tensively in the first three chapters of this book. The interested reader should 
review these chapters carefuUy before initiating DBT assessments with bor­
derline patients. 
INSIGHT (INTERPRETATION) STRATEGIES 
The goal of insight strategies, as the label suggests, is to help the patient no­
tice patterns and achieve insight into funaional interrelationships. Although 
this is a fundamental goal of behavioral analysis as described above, the ther­
apist may also offer his or her own "insights" at many other points in thera­
py, independently of a formal behavioral analysis. Offering therapeutic 
--- Page 285 ---
266 BASIC TREATMENT STRATEGIES 
insights (typicaUy labeled "interpretations" in more traditional psychothera-
pies) can be very powerful in both a positive and a negative sense. Thus, it 
is essential that they be offered as hypotheses to be tested rather than as im­
mutable facts. Furthermore, the therapist should be careful to recognize that 
the insights offered are products of his or her own cognitive processes, and 
thus are not necessarily accurate representations of events external to the 
therapist. 
Therapeutic behaviors that come under the rubric of insight include com­
menting on the patient's behavior; summarizing what a patient has said or 
done in such a way as to coordinate and emphasize certain aspeas; noticing 
and commenting on an observed interrelationship; and commenting on the 
implications of a particular patient behavior, such as an attitude or emotion 
that is implied. Offering such insights or interpretations is a fundamental part 
of all psychotherapy (Frank, 1973) as well as DBT. Insight is often used when 
the main focus of therapy is on another topic but the therapist wants to note 
a particular behavior or pattern for later reference. At other times, it may 
be the prelude to refocusing a session on topics the patient is avoiding or hop­
ing the therapist will not notice. Insights can be brief and subtle, as when 
the therapist wants to cue the patient to a behavior or pattern but wants the 
patient to arrive at the conclusion on her own, or confrontational, as when 
the therapist is trying to push the patient to a more active or more flexible 
stance. In contrast to behavioral analysis, insight strategies focus more often 
on behaviors occurring within the therapeutic interaaion. 
Insight strategies do not take the place of behavioral analysis. Insights 
are formulations of various theories about what the patient is doing and why 
she is doing it. In behavioral analysis, patient and therapist attempt to verify 
these insights. It is important to keep in mind, however, that interpretations, 
like others theories, cannot be evaluated in terms of "truth" but only in terms 
of utility. They either help in the change process or do not help, and at times 
they can actuaUy be detrimental. Kohlenberg and Tsai (1991) note that "every 
form of psychotherapy seems to include teaching the client to give reasons 
[for behavior] that are acceptable to the therapist." They go on to summarize 
Woolfolk and Messer (1988), who have suggested that psychoanalysis can 
be described as a process in which the patient tells what happened and gives 
reasons. The therapist then interprets, giving different reasons, and therapy 
is complete when the client's reasons are the same as the therapist's. Insight 
strategies are summarized in Table 9.2. 
What and How to Interpret: Guidelines for Insight 
Theorists differ markedly in regard to what behaviors should be interpreted 
with borderline patients and how these interpretations should be carried out. 
For example, Kernberg (1975) suggests focusing on the negative features of 
"transference." Masterson (1990) recommends keeping the focus on maladap­
tive behavior outside the session. Many clinicians support challenging and

tions (Sederer & Thorbeck, 1986; Schaffer, 1986). Both Gunderson (1984) 
and Schaffer (1986) stress the importance of empathetic or affirmative interpre­
tations. How does insight or interpretation in DBT differ from that offered 
in other types of therapies? The main differences are in the emphasis on ob-
--- Page 287 ---
268 BASIC TREATMENT STRATEGIES 
servable, targeted behavior (what to interpret), as well as the assumptions 
that guide insight formulation (how to interpret). 
What to Interpret 
There are three general guidelines about what patient behaviors can or should 
be interpreted. The first guideline is that the majority of comments should 
focus direaly on behaviors within the DBT hierarchy of targets or on behaviors 
functionally related to them. For example, suicidal behaviors or behaviors 
that commonly lead to them would take first priority; behaviors that either 
interfere with ongoing therapy or are prediaive of upcoming problems would 
take second priority; and so on. The second guideline is that, all other things 
being equal, insights should focus on observable or public behaviors and events 
as opposed to private ones. Behaviors become public (to the therapist) under 
two conditions: Either the therapist observes them, or the patient reports pri­
vate behaviors of her own that she has observed (e.g., what she is thinking 
or feeling or sensing). The third guideline is that insights should focus on 
events and behaviors in the present as opposed to those in the past. 
All these points taken together suggest that the most effective insights 
are those pertaining to the patient's behaviors as they occur in interactions 
with the therapist (by phone or in person). Data presented by Marziali (1984) 
suggest that the greater the extent to which interpretations are focused on 
in-session behaviors, the more positive the treatment outcome. This approach 
works best when the patient's problematic behaviors occur spontaneously or 
can be elicited during interactions with the therapist. As Kohlenberg and Tsai 
(1991) have pointed out, the ideal therapeutic relationship is one that evokes 
the patient's problematic or clinically relevant behaviors, while at the same 
time providing opportunities for developing more effective alternative be­
haviors. Problematic interpersonal styles and behavior patterns that interfere 
with therapy are the behaviors most likely to occur in a borderline patient's 
interaaions with her therapist, and thus the best candidates for insight. 
However, many other important problematic behaviors will occur in therapy 
interaaions, including suicidal ideation and threats, emotional dysregulation, 
intolerance of distress and agitation, failures in self-management and impul­
sive behaviors, difficulties with mindfulness (especially with observing and 
describing nonjudgmentally), and the full range of posttraumatic stress 
responses. Similarly, improvements in each of these areas are also likely to 
be demonstrated within therapeutic interactions. Thus, the therapist should 
attend closely for opportunities to observe and comment on instances of pa­
tient behaviors that are relevant to clinical progress. 
This constant but intermittent focus on behaviors occurring during the 
therapeutic session sets DBT apart from many other types of behavior thera­
py, where the usual focus is on behaviors occurring between sessions. The 
one exception to this guideline has to do with parasuicidal behavior and with 
planning and preparing for suicide, which rarely occur in the presence of the 
--- Page 288 ---
Core Strategies: Part II. Problem Solving 269 
therapist. Since these are high-priority behaviors, the therapist must attempt 
to buUd insight relevant to the faaors eliciting and maintaining these behaviors. 
Once the precursors are identified, however, the therapist should watch for 
their emergence in therapeutic interactions. For example, Mary was a patient 
of mine who characteristically cut her wrists whenever she felt intense emo­
tions and believed that others were not taking her feelings seriously. In ses­
sions, I noticed that Mary often communicated intense emotions in a bland, 
unemotional style, which made it difficult to take her seriously. I frequently 
commented that her verbal and nonverbal expressions conveyed different in­
formation, and that this made it hard for me to know how intensely she was 
actually feeling. At times, this comment would refocus the discussion on a 
behavioral analysis of factors controlling her verbal and nonverbal expres­
sions, there and then in the session. 
How to Interpret 
How one interprets can be just as important as what behaviors to focus on. 
Commenting on a person's behavior within an interaction and offering ideas 
about factors to which those behaviors may be related, have the potential to 
increase the intensity of the interaction markedly. If the person disagrees with 
a comment or interpretation, the attempts at insight not only may fail, but 
may create further problems that must be sorted out. Insight, especially when 
directed at current behavior, should be used with great care. 
There are three guidelines for the content and manner of interpretations 
in DBT that parallel to some extent the guidelines for what to interpret. The 
first guideline in that interpretations should be based on the biosocial theory 
described in Chapter 2, as well as on the DBT assumptions about patients 
outlined in Chapter 4. Indeed, one of the primary functions of any clinical 
theory or set of assumptions is to guide the therapist in construaing hypothet­
ical interpretations of patient behaviors. The therapist should focus comments 
on rules that govern the patient's behavior, as well as the ways in which her 
behavior is functionally related to immediate behavioral precursors and out­
comes, known psychological processes common to all people, biological in­
fluences, and situational events or contexts. Guidelines for formulating 
hypotheses about behavior during analysis, discussed above, are used in offer­
ing insights. 
The second guideline is that efforts must be made to find nonpejorative 
language for offering insights. All other things being equal, nonpejorative in­
sights should be entertained before pejorative ones. Similariy, insights that 
are congruent with the patient's phenomenological experience should be 
weighted more heavily than those that are incongruent. The exception here, 
as Chapter 12 indicates, is when the therapist uses irreverent communication 
strategies to effect change. In these instances, used strategically, interpreta­
tions may be both outrageous and anything but nonpejorative. (For exam­
ple, the therapist may say, "Are you trying again to get this therapy not to 
--- Page 289 ---
270 BASIC TREATMENT STRATEGIES 
work and to drive me crazy?" to a patient who engages in an already high­
lighted therapy-interfering behavior for what feels like the millionth time.) 
The third guideline is that interpretations should attempt to link cur­
rent behaviors to current events. Borderline patients are often desperate to 
know how they came to be the way they are; they often want to discuss early 
childhood events and to determine the role of their early learning history in 
the development of their problems. The therapist should not avoid such dis­
cussions completely, as the goal is obviously legitimate. But the point needs 
to be made that an understanding of the factors contributing to the develop­
ment of a pattern of behavior does not necessarily provide information about 
the factors responsible for the maintainance of the behavior Nor does such 
an analysis always point to how a patient can change. (Indeed, the patient 
may respond by saying, "How can I ever get better having been through my 
life?") The peace of mind a patient sometimes obtains from such discussions 
can be well worth the time if they are properly handled; however, they should 
not take the place of attempts to understand the patient's behavior in the 
present context. 
Timing of Interpretations 
There are no guidelines applicable to all patients for when to offer which 
interpretations in DBT. Three points are important. First, when and how much 
to interpret should be determined empirically and idiographically. That is, 
the therapist should observe the effea of an insight on the patient and should 
modify his or her behavior accordingly. Second, the DBT therapist does not 
ordinarily treat the borderline patient as fragile or unable to tolerate hearing 
the therapist's actual interpretation of something. Third, principles of shap­
ing guide which behaviors to ignore, untU later, in favor of other behaviors 
to focus on now. (See Chapter 10.) 
The four insight strategies are described next. 
I. HIGHLIGHTING 
In highlighting, the therapist gives the patient feedback about some aspect 
of what she is doing as a means of mirroring, highlighting, or bringing to 
the fore the patient's patterns of behavior Often the highlighting is very brief, 
perhaps only a succinct comment (e.g. "very interesting"), and the topic may 
not be discussed at great length until some time later Highlighting can often 
be phrased as a question (e.g., "Have you noticed that you have switched topics 
three times this session?"). 
Highlighting of negative behaviors is usually construed as criticism by 
everyone, and thus the therapist must be careful not to use this strategy as 
a cover for venting hostility or engaging in veiled criticism. Borderiine pa­
tients are very quick to pick up on this. Generally, it is a good idea to try 
to balance highlighting of a patient's strengths with a focus on problematic 
responses. 
--- Page 290 ---
Core Strategies: Part II. Problem Solving 271 
2. OBSERVING AND DESCRIBING RECURRENT PATTERNS 
An important part of any therapy is the construction of meaning out of life's 
events through observing recurrent, reliable patterns and relationships. In 
ongoing discussions of the patient's life as well as observations of behaviors 
occuring within the relationship, the therapist should be alert to recurrent 
relationships either among various patient behaviors or between behaviors 
and environmental events. In particular, the therapist should look for those 
relationships that will throw light on causal pattems. Thus, as in behavioral 
analysis, the focus is on noticing events that either elicit or reinforce behavior 
At times, it is most useful for the therapist to ask the patient first whether 
she sees any interesting patterns. Or the therapist can convey his or her point 
indirectly by summarizing either what the patient has just said or a sequence 
of events in such a way as to highlight the pattern observed. At other times, 
it is most helpful for the therapist to communicate directly his or her obser­
vations and to discuss the validity of these observations with the patient. 
3. COMMENTING ON IMPLICATIONS OF BEHAVIOR 
As noted earlier, DBT does not assume that people (including borderline 
patients) are ordinarily aware of the variables controlling or influencing their 
own behavior Although some rules guiding human behavior may be explicit, 
much of the time behavior is under the control of implicit rules and assump­
tions. Events that regularly elicit certain patterns of behavior, as well as events 
that funaion as reinforcers for behavior, also frequentiy funaion out of aware­
ness. DBT does not assume that this lack of awareness is necessarily the result 
of repression (i.e., that it is motivated nonawareness). Instead, it is assumed 
that most people most of the time have difficulty accurately identifying the 
factors that control their own behavior. Most of the time, indeed, such iden­
tification is not necessary. 
Generally, implications of behavior are based on "if-then" rules or rela­
tionships of which the patient may not be aware. By commenting, the ther­
apist is saying, "If your reaction is X, then Y is probably the case also." (In 
contrast, when observing and describing pattems the therapist is saying "Isn't 
it interesting that X and Y always go together") For example, if a patient 
says she wants to hit the therapist, a reasonable implication is that she is feel­
ing angry or threatened. If she avoids or escapes a situation, then she may 
be afraid or may believe that the simation is hopeless. Deciding to go back 
to school implies that she has some confidence that she will pass her courses. 
The therapist should be particularly careful about suggesting that conse­
quences of behavior are intended, especially when the consequences are painful 
or socially unacceptable. The theory and assumptions outlined in Chapters 
2 and 4 are especially important to keep in mind here. 
4. ASSESSING DIFFICULTIES IN ACCEPTING 
OR REJECTING HYPOTHESES 
A recurrent pattern or implication may not be recognized by the patient. At 
--- Page 291 ---
272 BASIC TREATMENT STRATEGIES 
other times, the pattem or implication may be recognized, but the patient may 
have difficulty either acknowledging it to the therapist or accepting it reality. 
Each of these alternatives should be explored with the patient when the ther­
apist and the patient disagree on the presence or implication of a behavioral 
pattem. At the same time, the therapist should be alert to his or her own 
biases and difficulties in relinquishing "insights." It is possible that the proffered 
insight is simply incorrect. In these discussions, it is critical that the therapist 
respect the patient's point of view; furthermore, the therapist should com­
municate both directly and indirectly to the patient that she and the therapist 
are involved in a mutual, collaborative effort. Thus, disagreements between 
patient and therapist should be approached nonevaluatively, and possible 
difficulties the patient may be having in recognizing patterns should be dis­
cussed in a matter-of-fact and accepting manner. 
In ongoing therapy, a patient will often offer her own insights and in­
terpretations of both the therapist's behavior and the pattern of interactions 
between the two (or, in group therapy, between the therapist and other group 
members). The therapist should be open to recognizing these patterns and 
to validating the patient's insights where appropriate. Searching for the valid­
ity should precede searching for the patient's projections, defensiveness, lack 
of skill in offering insights, or ulterior motives in directing the discussion 
toward the therapist's behavior Especially when the pattems are less than 
admirable behaviors on the therapist's part, this situation provides an oppor­
tunity both to reinforce valid observations and to model nondefensive, non-
self-evaluative self-exploration. This topic is discussed more extensively in 
Chapters 12 and 15. 
DIDACTIC STRATEGIES 
The essence of the didactic strategies is the imparting of information about 
factors known to influence behavior in general, and of psychological, bio­
logical, and sociological theories that might cast light on particular behavior 
patterns. Information about borderline behaviors (including parasuicidal be­
haviors) and BPD, empirical data on various treatment strategies, and theo­
retical points of view are conveyed to the patient, and at times to her family 
or social network as weU. The specific information imparted here is discussed 
in more detail in Chapter 14. The strategies are summarized in Table 9.3. 
A basic didactic strategy is the direct teaching of the foUowing princi­
ples of leaming and development; biological consequences of various behavior 
patterns (including drug ingestion); and basic emotional, cognitive, and be­
havioral processes. Usually didactic information is imparted as it relates to 
effeaive methods of behavior change and self-control relevant to the patient's 
own problems. However, at times such information is also usefiil in under­
standing the behavior of others related to the patient. This didaaic strategy 
is used to help the patient focus on relevant information during behavioral 
analysis, to generate solutions, and to make decisions and commitments to

specific goals in treatment. Information given didaaically is meant to coun­
teract overly moralistic, superstitious, and unrealistic views of behavior and 
change. The assumption is that borderline patients are often woefully lack­
ing in such knowledge; they frequently have inadequate information about 
factors that typicaUy influence behavior and about normative responses to 
situations in which they find themselves. This lack may be due to a variety 
of factors, including the deficient or faulty teaching and learning typical of 
invalidating environments. 
I. PROVIDING INFORMATION 
As noted previously, borderline and suicidal individuals quite often trace their 
problems to uncontrollable negative personal attributes; they often believe 
they are "going crazy," are "losing control," or are "terrible" persons because 
of their problems. A patient frequently has only two explanations for her own 
behavior and state of life: She is either crazy or evil (i.e., "mad or bad"). An 
alternative or rival conceptualization—namely, that the patient's behavior is 
a result of problematic learning histories or ordinary psychological pro­
cesses—can often be quite helpful. Thus, whenever possible, learning-based 
explanations or other current, empirically based psychological theories should 
be offered, and attempts on the part of the patient to explain her behavior 
as a result of "mental iUness" or "sin" should be refuted directly. 
The emphasis on psychological explanations certainly does not rule out 
biological or genetic explanations of behavior when these are appropriate. 
--- Page 293 ---
274 BASIC TREATMENT STRATEGIES 
For example, it is appropriate to explain a borderline individual's extreme 
emotional lability as attributable in part to genetic or biological faaors and 
dispositions. Distorted perceptions, cognitive biases (especially in memory), 
and rigid thinking can in turn be explained as ordinary and typical conse­
quences of high emotional arousal. Problems in concentrating or attending 
may be attributed to depression, which may additionally be explained as stem­
ming in part from physiological faaors or genetic predisposition. Other 
problems may be chemicaUy induced (e.g., lethargy and lack of motivation 
may be the result of poor nutrition, overeating, drug use, etc). At all times, 
the therapist must walk the fine line between indicating to the patient that 
problems may be due to faulty learning histories and suggesting that the 
problems result from more immutable characteristics of the patient. Here the 
dialeaic of change versus acceptance is most important, and the therapist 
must be careful to synthesize these two points of view rather than to main­
tain either side of the coin as an independent truth. 
2. GIVING READING MATERIALS 
Some patients are willing and eager to read information relevant to their 
problems. Patients can be given this book; the accompanying skills training 
manual; articles and research papers on BPD as well as other diagnostic criteria 
that they meet; outcome studies pertaining to psychosocial and pharmaco­
logical treatments; textbooks or readings on introductory psychology, social 
psychology, behavior therapy, or other procedures the therapist may be us­
ing; self-help books that contain accurate and sound information on topics 
the therapist would like the patient to understand better (such as principles 
of leaming, or sexual abuse and its effects on people); and so on. Generally, 
I try to teach patients as much as I know. Thus, any materials I am reading 
may be given to the patient. Most patients will not read long-winded or aca­
demically dry books, but many will read brief articles or book chapters. Un­
fortunately, most popular books on BPD present a theoretical formulation 
of the disorder that differs from the DBT formulation. In particular, many 
convey an idea that the individual's disordered behavior is caused by a "men­
tal illness" from which the individual must recover before real changes can 
be made. DBT is not based on a mental illness conception of BPD; if it did 
accept one, it would suggest that making real changes is likely to cure it rather 
than vice versa. 
3. GIVING INFORMATION TO FAMILY MEMBERS 
The family of a borderiine or suicidal individual often blames the patient for 
her difficulties. This blame is usually based on faulty information about be­
havior and BPD, and grows out of the family's frustration in trying to under­
stand and help the patient. Whatever the reason, the family's inability to 
develop a theory of the patient's behavior that is compassionate and non-
--- Page 294 ---

pejorative can be especially painful for both the patient and the family Many 
of the patient's maladaptive behaviors are misguided attempts to change the 
family's negative and judgmental views of her One of the most important 
tasks of family therapy sessions is for the therapist to impart to the family 
didactic information about the formation and maintenance of BPD and bor­
derline behaviors. They are given the same information as that given to pa­
tients (for a fuller discussion, see Chapter 14). The therapist must remember, 
of course, that attempts to change the point of view of a patient's family must 
also be surrounded by the judicious use of validating strategies. 
SOLUTION ANALYSIS STRATEGIES 
DBT and behavior therapy in general assume that conduaing behavioral ana­
lyses and achieving insight into the origin, pattem, and maintenance of one's 
problems are rarely sufficient to effea permanent behavioral change. Instead, 
once understanding and insight are achieved, therapist and patient must pro­
ceed with an aaive attempt to generate adaptive behavior patterns that can 
replace maladaptive behaviors and to develop a plan for making change come 
about. Aversive life situations presented by the patient are treated by the ther­
apist as problems that can be solved, even if the solution only means a new 
way of adapting to life as it is (i.e., problem acceptance rather than problem 
solving and change). In solution analysis, the therapist aaively models solv­
ing problems and, over the course of therapy, elicits and reinforces the gener­
ation and use of active problem solutions by the patient. The steps discussed 
below can be utilized in any order and combination to suit the particular sit­
uation. They are also summarized in Table 9.4. 
Levels of Analysis 
At the first level of analysis, in the beginning of therapy, the therapist and 
patient must decide whether their goals are compatible. The goal of DBT 
is to reduce borderline and suicidal behaviors as methods of coping with 
problems by working collaboratively with the patient to build a life worth 
living. If this is not a goal of the patient, however tentative, then problem 
solving cannot progress. At the second level, the therapist is examining whether 
the patient wants to improve other behaviors targeted in DBT. Beyond reduc­
ing parasuicidal behaviors and therapy-interfering behaviors, all other goals 
are dependent on the patient. The exception here is an instance when the 
therapist believes that a particular goal is essential to any further therapeutic 
progress. At the third level, the net is cast much wider, although the focus 
should remain on the problem situation under consideration. BasicaUy, the 
question is "What would have to change for the problem to be solved or the 
situation to improve?" At this third level, it is also important for the therapist

to be sure that the patient does want to work on solving the problem at hand. 
Sometimes the patient (like anyone else) just wants to tell someone about her 
problem, have the other person understand and commiserate with her, and 
let it go at that. Insisting on continuing to "solve" the problem can be coun­
terproductive in such instances. At other times, if wishing to stop at problem 
definition is a characteristic form of avoiding problem solving, the therapist 
may need to skip to the commitment strategies (see below) first, in order to 
obtain an initial agreement even to work on the problem. 
I. IDENTIFYING GOALS, NEEDS, AND DESIRES 
Impediments to the Patient's Knowing What She Wants 
Suicidal individuals often suggest that their goal in life is to be dead, or that 
what they desire is to cut or otherwise hurt themselves or to engage in some 
other impulsive behavior In essence, such an individual is representing self-
destructive behavior as the solution to her problems. The first task of the 
therapist is to point out that it is very unlikely that the patient actually wants 
--- Page 296 ---
Core Strategies: Part II. Problem Solving 277 
to engage in suicidal behavior; rather, she probably wants to solve the problem 
that she is experiencing, to feel better, and to be more satisfied with her life. 
Such a statement should then be followed by a comment that there are prob­
ably other ways of obtaining these goals. The patient may continue to insist 
that what she really wants is to be dead or to hurt herself; the therapist may 
feel that what is really wanted is the therapist's permission to engage in self-
destructive behavior The patient may aauaUy be attempting to get the ther­
apist to recognize how bad she is feeling. A useful technique here is simply 
to validate the patient's pain, and to follow such statements up with a refocus­
ing of the conversation on alternative solutions. At times, this circular process 
may be required 10 or 20 times within a single interaaion. At other times, 
(even in the same interaction), the patient will state that she does not want 
to change anything and that everything is fine. Such statements generally come 
from feelings of hopelessness and lack of control. 
A fundamental dialeaical tension in setting goals is that it is almost im­
possible for the patient to know what she wants if she is not free to choose 
and get what she wishes for Often, it is simply not useful to engage in lengthy 
discussions regarding what the patient wants in particular situations. The ther­
apy time is better used in first increasing the patient's ability to attain a range 
of goals. For example, I had a borderline patient who could not decide what 
she wanted from coworkers, or whether she wanted to be promoted, to stay 
on the current job, or to quit. After a number of lengthy discussions, it be­
came apparent to me that the patient's extreme lack of assertive behavior ac­
tually prevented her from ever standing up for herself at work, from going 
for the promotion, or from searching for a different job. When I suggested 
that we work on learning to stand up for herself and handle conflict directly, 
she complained that she couldn't because she never knew what she wanted 
in conflict situations. My strategy was to teach her how to stand up for a 
variety of issues and ask for any number of things, reasoning with her that 
she might as weU learn how to ask for the "sun and the moon"; she could 
decide what to ask for later By the time she was competent at assertion, 
we did not need the discussion on goals and wishes. She knew what she 
wanted. 
At times, especially when devising new reponses to crisis situations, the 
therapist should generate possible goals or objectives, describing them together 
vrith any means by which the patient might attain them. The therapist should 
make repeated attempts if necessary to engage the patient in a discussion of 
these therapist-generated goals, taking care to focus on short-term, realistic 
goals rather than long-term, seemingly unattainable goals. It may be use­
ful to generate with the patient a list of possible goals or objectives for a par­
ticular problem and then rank-order them from most desirable to least de­
sirable. 
A final major impediment to the identification of goals, needs, and desires 
is the consistent tendency of suicidal and borderline individuals to believe 
that they do not actually deserve happiness, the good Hfe, love, or the like. 
--- Page 297 ---
278 BASIC TREATMENT STRATEGIES 
This belief in their utter worthlessness must be countered at every turn. Tech­
niques and strategies for changing such dysfunaional beliefs are described 
more fully in Chapter 11. 
2. GENERATING SOLUTIONS 
Levels of Solutions 
As I have noted, at the initial level one possible solution to the patient's 
problems is getting into and staying in DBT. Other solution strategies-in 
particular, combining DBT with pharmacotherapy or other ancUlary ther­
apies-should also be explored. At the second level, the solution may be one 
or more of the specific problem-solving procedures making up DBT. Once 
a particular pattem of behavior is identified as an appropriate solution, new 
problems may emerge that must be responded to first. That is, the patient 
may not be able to utilize the solutions in her present state. At the third level, 
therapist and patient simply generate solutions to specific problems as they 
arise, or they may generate new, more effective ways to handle old problems. 
Once a solution is generated and chosen, the patient may be able to imple­
ment it, or may at least make a good attempt. In day-to-day individual DBT, 
these two latter approaches are typically interwoven. 
Day-to-day Solution Generation 
During the conduct of the behavioral analysis, the therapist will have noted 
along the chain possible alternative responses the individual could have made 
to solve the problem at hand. Conducting a chain analysis is a bit like con­
structing a road map to see how the patient got from one point to the next. 
Like all road maps, however, a chain often also indicates other "roads" the 
patient could have taken. These other roads, or solutions, should be pointed 
out as the analysis is constructed. However, it is usuaUy not advisable at this 
time to go into lengthy discussions at each juncture about all the possible 
alternative solutions. Such a discussion often diverts both therapist and pa­
tient from the task of construaing the complete chain. At times, this point­
ing out of alternative solutions is all that is done by way of solution analysis. 
At other times, a more complete solution analysis is conduaed. This may 
be done in a phone conversation during a crisis, when the patient is attempt­
ing to cope with a problem in a more adaptive way. Or it may be done during 
a therapy session in which the point is to generate solutions to a current cri­
sis situation. Alternatively, much of therapy can be viewed as attempting to 
generate and implement new solutions to chronic problems faced by the pa­
tient. The first task in these cases is to "brainstorm" solutions. The therapist 
should ask the patient whether she can think of any other ways to solve her 
problem. It is important to elicit as many altemative solutions as she can pos­
sibly think of. The patient's tendency will be to reject many solutions out 
--- Page 298 ---
Core Strategies: Part II. Problem Solving 279 
of hand; thus, much urging and encouraging will be needed to get her to stop 
evaluating and simply to generate altematives. The therapist should teach and 
model the "quantity breeds quality" principle underlying brainstorming taaics. 
If the patient generates a list of solutions, one or more of which seem 
effective, than there is no need for the therapist to contribute other solutions. 
At the beginning of therapy, however, this is not Hkely to happen. At this point 
the therapist must not be fooled by the "apparent competence" of the patient 
into believing that she aaually knows how to solve the problem but simply 
is not motivated or is too lazy to generate a good alternative. This is rarely 
the case. The eventual goal here is for the patient to generate, remember, and 
implement new behaviors independently of the therapist. Therefore, prompting 
should be faded over time, with an increasing emphasis on drawing from the 
patient specific behavioral plans for how to solve specific problems. 
Because suicidal and borderline patients are unusually rigid and dichoto­
mous in their thinking, a patient will often present the therapist with only 
one solution to a problem. If this solution is adaptive (or at least better than 
the patient's usual solutions), the therapist should, of course, reinforce her 
However, quite often the solution presented is inadequate, is maladaptive, or 
otherwise is not the best solution possible (at least in the opinion of the ther­
apist). New solutions must be generated. 
Often, the patient cannot generate an effective aaion plan or is ham­
pered from suggesting effeaive alternatives by emotional inhibitions or faulty 
beliefs and expectations about the outcomes she perceives as associated with 
such alternatives. In these instances, it is helpful for the therapist to suggest 
various aaion plans for solving the problem. The therapist may also need 
to help the patient develop specific strategies for coping with self-damaging 
behaviors that might sabotage the implementation of a solution. 
3. EVALUATING SOLUTIONS 
Solutions must be evaluated in terms of both their potential effeaiveness and 
possible obstacles to carry them out. 
Analyzing Potential Effectiveness of Solutions 
The therapist should carefully assess the patient's expeaancies regarding the 
UtUity of the outcomes (both short-term and long-term) associated with vari­
ous solutions. During these discussions, the therapist can help the patient 
assess how realistic these expectancies are. The therapist should not auto­
matically assume that negative expectancies on the part of the patient are 
unrealistic; she may indeed be functioning in an aversive environmental situ­
ation where the range of possible negative outcomes may be substantial. When 
a patient reports negative expeaancies, it may be preferable for the therapist 
to respond by asking how such expected outcomes might be overcome or 
mitigated. 
--- Page 299 ---
280 BASIC TREATMENT STRATEGIES 
At other times, the therapist will feel that the patient is engaging in the 
"Yes, but. . ." syndrome: Every solution proposed by the therapist is discussed 
as inadequate. In these cases, the therapist should identify his or her sense 
of what is happening within the therapy interaaion and ask the patient 
for suggestions to resolve the impasse. It may be helpful to discuss the 
patient's expectations of the therapy process. Once again, it is important 
to validate the patient's probable frustration and despair rather than to ac­
cuse the patient (direaly or indirealy) of throwing roadblocks into the therapy. 
Analyzing Possible Obstacles to Effective Solutions 
A particular solution may be effective if employed, but for one reason or 
another the patient may not be able to use it in everyday life. Careful analysis 
of faaors that may interfere with solution implementation is, therefore, a very 
important part of problem solving. 
The analysis of possible obstacles in DBT is based on the behavior deficit 
and response inhibition models I have proposed previously for the analysis 
of failures in assertive behavior (Linehan, 1979). The behavior deficit model 
assumes that failure to use effective behavior when it is needed is the result 
of a deficiency; that is, relevant, effective behaviors (i.e., aaions plus know­
ledge of how and when to use them) are absent from the individual's behavioral 
repertoire. The response inhibition model assumes that the person has the 
requisite behaviors but is inhibited from performing. There are two hypotheses 
about the determinants of inhibition. The first hypothesis is that it is due 
to conditioned negative affeaive responses; the second is that it results from 
maladaptive beliefs, self-statements, and expectations. A variant of the 
response inhibition approach assumes that the person has the requisite be­
haviors, but that performance of these behaviors is interfered with. Once again, 
there are two major sources of interference. First, a response may be precluded 
by the prior emission of incompatible behaviors; that is, inappropriate, in­
compatible behaviors are higher in the individual's response hierarchy than 
are appropriate, effective responses. Second, the contingencies operating in 
the current environment may favor ineffeaive over effeaive behavior. Effec­
tive behaviors may be punished and ineffeaive behaviors rewarded. 
In analyzing solutions to a particular problem situation or life pattern, 
the therapist must be careful to assess the variables influencing the patient's 
behavior in that particular area, instead of blindly applying a preformulated 
theory. Once the therapist and patient have figured out what is interfering 
with the use of effective problem-solving behaviors, they can jointly consider 
how to proceed. If there is a skill deficit, skills training may be in order Inhi­
bition stemming from conditioned fears or guilt usually indicates the need 
for exposure-based techniques. Faulty beliefs may be remedied with formal 
cognitive modification procedures. Problematic contingencies in the environ­
ment suggest contingency management procedures. These procedures are 
described in detail in Chapters 10 and 11.

4. CHOOSING A SOLUTION TO IMPLEMENT 
Generating, evaluating, and discussing potential solutions to problems are 
means to an end. They do not constitute the end itself, although the patient 
would often like this to be the case. The goal is to implement a solution that 
has some likelihood of working or of improving the situation. Thus, during 
the course of evaluation, the therapist should guide the patient in choosing 
a particular solution as the one to proceed with. Although there are many 
ways to organize criteria for this choice, the therapist should pay particular 
attention to long-term over short-term value, and to the effects of various so­
lutions on meeting the patient's wishes or goals (objeaive effectiveness), main­
taining or enhancing interpersonal relationships (interpersonal effeaiveness), 
and maintaining or enhancing the patient's respect for herself (self-respect 
effectiveness). (A fuller description of these types of effectiveness is given in 
the accompanying skills training manual.) Working together on this step is 
an important means of helping the patient improve her abilities to make de­
cisions according to appropriate judgmental criteria. 
When the solution involves implementation of specific DBT procedures, 
the role of the therapist in helping the patient make the choice is much great­
er For example, when skUls training, exposure, or cognitive modification tech­
niques are chosen to attack a problem, consensus between patient and therapist 
is essential, as these procedures require close cooperation. In contrast, con­
tingency management can be implemented unilaterally by either the patient 
(through reinforcing or punishing therapist behaviors) or the therapist. The 
key here, however, is that the therapist must remain flexible, willing to enter­
tain the idea that there are many roads to Rome. 
5. TROUBLESHOOTING THE SOLUTION 
In troubleshooting a solution, therapist and patient discuss all the ways im­
plementation of the solution can go wrong and what the patient can do about 
it. The idea here is to prepare the patient for difficulties and to think ahead 
of time about ways to solve new problems that come up. At the beginning 
of therapy and in crisis management, the therapist should be very active here. 
Troubleshooting is often combined with the rehearsal of new solutions, dis­
cussed below in connection with orienting. The most important thing about 
troubleshooting is to remember to do it. 
ORIENTING STRATEGIES 
Orienting and commitment strategies are always interwoven and are pulled 
apart here for the sake of exposition. Orienting involves giving patients task 
information about the process and requirements of DBT as a whole (at the 
first level, where DBT is a general case of problem solving); about a treat-
--- Page 301 ---
282 BASIC TREATMENT STRATEGIES 
ment procedure that wUl be employed (e.g., behavioral skills training to pro­
vide altematives to suiddai behaviors); or about what is required in implement­
ing a specific solution selected during the solution analysis of a particular 
problem situation. Specifics on orienting the patient to therapy as a whole 
are outlined in Chapter 14. Before each instance of new learning, however, 
a simUar orientation or task overview should be presented direaly and deHber-
ately to the patient in order to provide precise information about what has 
to be learned, as well as a clarification of the conceptual model within which 
the learning will take place. 
Many apparent failures to learn stem from failures to understand what 
has to be learned, rather than problems with acquisition or memory. Com­
prehension of the task is improved if requirements of the task are clarified 
before practice begins; adequate learning can be assured only if the patient 
knows exactly what has to be learned. Other failures in teaching skills may 
result from inadequate clarification of the conceptual model or rationale un­
derlying the procedure. The importance of the treatment rationale in affect­
ing therapeutic gain has been demonstrated by Rosen (1974) as well as by 
others. 
Task reorienting will have to be conducted repeatedly during treatment 
as a general first step in repeated recommitments to therapy, to specific ther­
apeutic procedures, and to implemention of previousUy agreed-upon be­
havioral solutions. The general idea is that progress will be smoother and 
faster if the patient has as much information as possible about the require­
ments for change, the rationale for the treatment strategies selected, and the 
relationship of treatment process to outcome. Orienting strategies are sum­
marized in Table 9.5 and are described below. 
I. PROVIDING ROLE INDUCTION 
Role induction involves clarifying for the patient what she may realistically 
anticipate from the treatment or treatment procedure itself and from the ther­
apist. The focus here is on what the patient and therapist will actually do, 
both during therapy as a whole and in implementing a specific procedure; 
what the therapist can expea from the patient, as well as what the patient 
can expect from the therapist, is clarified. When a specific intervention is dis­
cussed, its targets and their relation to the patient's needs and desires are em­
phasized. Role induction is important because negative feelings toward both 
the therapist and the treatment can result from misinformation or lack of in­
formation about what the patient can realistically expea during the course 
of therapy Conversely, events that confirm the patient's early-established ex­
pectancies are likely to increase her sense of attraction toward and trust of 
the therapist. 
The clarification of mutual expectations should be discussed through­
out therapy. In particular, the therapist should be alert to picking up unver-

balized, unrealistic expectancies on the part of the patient. Such expectations 
should be reflected and summarized back to the patient in a nonjudgmental 
fashion, and clarifying discussions should follow. It is important that the ther­
apist communicate understanding of how the patient may have arrived at such 
unrealistic expeaancies. As always, a balance between acceptance and change 
should be maintained. 
2. REHEARSING NEW EXPECTATIONS 
In helping a patient prepare to implement a new behavioral response to an 
old or new problem, the therapist should go over with the patient in detail 
just what is expected of her—that is, exactly what she is to do. With a highly 
agitated patient, in particular, there simply is no substitute for a detaUed, step-
by-step review of the aaions the patient is to try. Generally, this review should 
be carried out as the solution is discussed and chosen. It can be briefly run 
through again just before the session or phone interaction ends. Some pa­
tients may need to write down each step; others may need to write down the 
rationale for implementing the solution so they can "cheerlead" themselves 
when necessary. This cognitive rehearsal is itself an instance of new learning 
and an aid to memory that will enhance performance in the problem situ­
ation. 
By the time therapist and patient finish reviewing what the patient is ex­
peaed to do, the patient may be too discouraged to make the attempt if the 
therapist fails to interweave a heavy amount of validation along the way. I 
usually first commiserate with the patient about how hard it is going to be. 
Then I point out that I did not make up the laws of leaming and I don't like 
them any better than she does. I think of this as the "Yes, but. . ." strategy 
in reverse. 
--- Page 303 ---
284 BASIC TREATMENT STRATEGIES 
COMMITMENT STRATEGIES 
The final problem-solving step is eliciting and maintaining a commitment 
from the patient to implement the solution chosen. An enormous amount 
of evidence indicates that the commitment to behave in a particular way—or, 
more generally, commitment to a behavioral project such as a task, job, or 
relationship —is strongly related to future performance (e.g., Wang & Kat-
zev, 1990; Hall, Havassy, & Wasserman, 1990). People are more likely to 
do what they agree to do. They are more likely to stay in jobs and relation­
ships to which they have made strong commitments. 
Levels of Commitment 
At the initial stages of therapy, the commitment sought from a patient is to 
participate in DBT with this particular therapist for a specified period of time 
and to keep the patient agreements outlined in Chapter 4. At a very mini­
mum at the beginning of therapy, the patient must agree to work toward 
eliminating suicidal behavior and building a more worthwhile life. In-session 
behaviors that may be addressed as inconsistent with this degree of commit­
ment and coUaboration include refusing to work in therapy; avoiding or refus­
ing to talk about feelings and events connected with target behaviors; and 
rejecting aU input from the therapist or attempts to generate alternative solu­
tions. At these moments, the commitment to therapy itself should be ana­
lyzed and discussed, with the goal of eliciting a recommitment. The moments 
(sometimes very rare in the beginning) when a patient does display a com­
mitted and collaborative attitude call for alert reinforcement by the therapist. 
At the second level, the commitment sought is for the patient is to col­
laborate in the specific treatment procedures selected. If skills training proce­
dures are implemented, the commitment is for her to work on learning and 
applying new, more skillful behavior in problem situations. With exposure, 
the commitment is for her to enter the feared or otherwise stressful situation, 
to experience rather than avoid emotions, or to think or do things that she 
is afraid to try. With cognitive modification, the commitment is for her to 
examine and attempt to modify when necessary her assumptions, beliefs, and 
characteristic patterns of thought related to problem behaviors. Contingency 
management strategies differ from the others, in that the type and degree of 
collaboration needed are somewhat different. In contingency management, 
the therapist applies contingencies based on observations or reports of the 
patient's behavior The assumption is that exposure to new contingencies will 
change behavior Thus, the requisite commitment on the part of the patient 
is both to expose herself to the contingencies and to be honest in reporting 
her own behavior For most patients in DBT, each of these commitments will 
be necessary. 
At the third level, the commitment is to implement whatever behavioral 
solution the patient and therapist have selected in a solution analysis. The 
--- Page 304 ---
Core Strategies: Part II. Problem Solving 285 
idea here is that the therapist should direaly elicit the patient's agreement 
to try a new behavior, to work on a specific problem, or the like. 
Commitment and Recommitment 
In my experience, one of the chief reasons for many therapy failures and ear­
ly terminations is inadequate commitment by either the patient, the therapist, 
or both. There may be insufficient or glib commitment in the initial stages 
of the change process, or more likely, events both within and without thera­
py may conspire to reduce strong commitments made previously. Patient com­
mitment in DBT is both an important prerequisite for effective therapy and 
a goal of the therapy. Thus, a commitment to change or to implement new 
behavioral solutions to old problems is not assumed. Commitment is viewed 
as itself a behavior, which can be elicited, learned, and reinforced. The task 
of the therapist is to figure out ways to help this process along. 
Throughout treatment, the therapist can expea that the patient will need 
reminding of the commitments she has made, as well as assistance in refin­
ing, expanding, and remaking behavioral commitments (sometimes over and 
over). In some cases, a patient and I have had to go back to the original com­
mitment several times within a single (very difficult) session, making and 
remaking it. On other occasions, one or more whole sessions may be needed 
to readdress issues of commitment to change, to DBT, or to particular proce­
dures. A faUure in commitment should be one of the first things assessed (but 
not assumed) when a problem in therapy arises. Before moving to solve the 
problem, the therapist should first go back with the patient to the commit­
ment strategy. Once recommitment is made, both can proceed with address­
ing the problem at hand. 
Sometimes the uncommitted partner is the therapist, not the patient. This 
can happen under a number of circumstances. The patient may have been 
demanding resources that the therapist does not have available, or may have 
faUed to make progress for a long time. Or progress that is being made may 
be so slow that it is imperceptible to the therapist. Sometimes, after a lot of 
progress, when the patient is reorganizing or integrating changes, the ther­
apist simply loses interest in the patient. There may be value clashes, or after 
the crises that were so consuming at the beginning of therapy have passed, 
the therapist may find that he or she simply does not like the patient. Cir­
cumstances in the therapist's life may have changed in such a way that treat­
ing this particular patient is no longer a priority or no longer rewarding. I 
suspect that many therapeutic faUures in commitment that have been laid at 
the feet of borderline patients could more properly be laid at the feet of their 
therapists. Therefore, the therapist must analyze his or her level of commit­
ment to the patient and develop new, more vigorous commitments as need­
ed. The most appropriate arena for this work is the DBT case consultation 
team, although loss of commitment is also an important clue that a patient 
therapy-interfering behavior may be on the scene. 
--- Page 305 ---
286 BASIC TREATMENT STRATEGIES 
The Need for Flexibility 
It perhaps goes without saying, but flexibility and respect for the patient's 
own wishes, goals, and ideas about "how to get from here to there" are need­
ed. Thus, the therapist should avoid being judgmental about the patient's 
choice of goals and/or commitments. The therapist should be careful not to 
impose his or her own goals or treatment procedures on the patient when 
such goals or procedures are not diaated by DBT or the therapist's own limits. 
Although it is tempting to present arbitrary therapist choices or preferences 
as necessary, such a tendency must somehow be averted or corrected when 
noticed. The case consultation team can be particularly useful here. 
Eliciting a commitment from a patient may involve a number of steps. 
The therapist is often functioning like a good salesperson. The product be­
ing sold is DBT, new behavior, a renewed effort to change, or sometimes life 
itself. All or most of the steps discussed below and outlined in Table 9.6 may 
be needed when the task requires great effort on the part of the patient; when 
effort must be sustained over a long period or in the face of adversity or at­
tempts by others to dissuade the patient; when the patient feels hopeless about 
her capacity to change; or when what is required is something the patient 
fears greatly. The best example here is making the commitment to therapy 
in the first place, which is discussed in Chapter 14. At other times, only a 
request for a verbal commitment may be needed, and other taaics can be 
discarded. The therapist should feel free to move back and forth among the 
various strategies as needed. 
I. SELLING COMMITMENT: 
EVALUATING THE PROS AND CONS 
People keep commitments they believe in better than those they do not be­
lieve in. Thus, once one or more action plans have been proposed, the ther­
apist should engage the patient in a discussion of the pros and cons of aaually 
making a commitment to a specific plan or solution. The idea here is twofold: 
(1) to rehearse the good points of the solution already evaluated and chosen 
in the solution analysis; and (2) to develop counterarguments to reservations 
that will almost certainly come up later, usually when the patient is alone 
and without help in combating doubts. The therapist should make an effort 
to relate commitments to change to the patient's own life patterns, to realis­
tic expeaations for the future, and to the rationale and expected outcomes 
for therapy. 
2. PLAYING THE DEVIL'S ADVOCATE 
At times, a patient will make a facile commitment that will not be strong 
enough to stand up during ftiture adversity. Thus, once a tentative commit­
ment is made, the therapist should try to increase the commitment if at all

288 BASIC TREATMENT STRATEGIES 
possible. The discussion of pros and cons (see above) is one way; another 
is the "devil's advocate" technique discussed in Chapter 7. In this case, the 
therapist poses arguments against making a commitment. The secret here is 
to make sure that the counterarguments are slightly weaker than the patient's 
arguments for commitment. If the counterarguments are too strong, the pa­
tient may capitulate and retract her initial commitment. When this happens, 
the therapist should back down sHghtly and reinforce the arguments for com­
mitment, and then revert back once more to the devil's advocate position. 
This tactic is also helpful in enhancing the patient's sense of choice and "illu­
sion" of control. 
3. "FOOT-INTHE-DOOR/DOOR-INTHE-FACE" TECHNIQUES 
The "foot-in-the-door" (Freedman & Fraser, 1966) and "door-in-the face" 
(Cialdini et al., 1975) techniques are well-known social-psychological proce­
dures for enhancing compliance with requests and previously made commit­
ments. (The terms come from the initial research on door-to-door canvassing 
for donations to charities.) In the foot-in-the-door technique, the therapist 
increases compliance by making an easier first request followed by a more 
difficult request (e.g., first getting the patient to agree to make a difficult phone 
call, and then obtaining her subsequent agreement to try to use her new in­
terpersonal skills on the phone). In the door-in-the-face technique, the proce­
dure is reversed: The therapist first requests something much larger than he 
or she actually expects, and then requests something easier (e.g., first request­
ing the patient to agree not to harm herself during the upcoming week, and 
then requesting her to call the therapist before harming herself). A combined 
procedure —asking first for something very hard, then moving to something 
very easy, and progressing up to a more difficult request—may at times be 
the most effective strategy (Goldman, 1986). All three strategies are likely to 
be more effective than simply asking directly for a commitment. 
When the therapist is obtaining commitment to therapy itself or to a par­
ticular treatment procedure, a variation of the combined strategy may be used 
as follows. First, the therapist presents goals (of therapy or of the procedure) 
somewhat vaguely and in a favorable light, omitting discussion of how hard 
goals will be to reach, so that almost anyone would agree. Second, the ther­
apist elicits the patient's commitment to reach these goals. Third, the ther­
apist redescribes the goals, presenting more specifics and highlighting the 
difficulties a bit more. Fourth, the therapist elicits another commitment to 
reach goals. Fifth, the therapist "ups the ante," presenting goals as very difficult 
to reach, perhaps more difficult than anything the patient has ever attempted 
(and more difficult than they may actually be)-but attainable if the patient 
wants to try Finally, the therapist elicits another commitment to reach goals. 
In eliciting commitments to engage in homework practice or to try new 
behaviors, the door-in-the-face procedure is often most successful. For ex­
ample, I may first ask a patient to practice a new skill every day, and then 
--- Page 308 ---
Core Strategies: Part II. Problem Solving 289 
scale the request back to once or twice between now and the next session. 
Once the patient agrees to this, and if I think successful compliance is likely, 
I may raise the request slightly to three times before the next session. 
4. CONNECTING PRESENT COMMITMENTS 
TO PRIOR COMMITMENTS 
A variation on the foot-in-the-door tactic is to remind the patient of previous 
commitments. This should always be done when the strength of a commit­
ment seems to be fading or when the patient's behavior is incongruent with 
her previous commitments ("But I thought we/you had agreed. . ."). It can 
be particularly useful in a crisis situation, especially when the patient is 
threatening suicide or some other destruaive response; developing new com­
mitments during a crisis can be exceptionally difficult. This tactic can also 
be quite satisfying for the therapist and is preferable to attacking the patient 
or threatening immediate counterbehaviors. For example, a new patient once 
called me (as director of the clinic) in a crisis over the humiliation she felt 
at having to go to group skills training. When I did not give her permission 
to quit the group and still continue in our program, she said, "OK, then I'll 
just have to hurt myself." I immediately said, "But I thought you were going 
to try your best not to do that? That's one of the commitments you made 
on entering therapy with us." 
In reminding the patient of previous commitments, the therapist should 
also discuss whether the patient stiU has a commitment made previously, and 
should then help the patient clarify her commitments. If a commitment or 
goal is essential to DBT (such as committing to working on parasuicidal be­
havior in the example above) or to the therapist's own limits, the therapist 
should next focus on establishing a recommitment. If changes do not con­
flict with DBT or the therapist's limits, then renegotiation of commitments 
may be in order 
5. HIGHLIGHTING FREEDOM TO CHOOSE 
AND ABSENCE OF ALTERNATIVES 
Commitment and compliance are enhanced both when people believe that 
they have chosen a commitment freely and when they believe that there are 
no altemative paths to their goals. Thus, the therapist should try to enhance 
the feeling of choice, while at the same time stressing the lack of alternative 
ways to achieve the patient's goals. The way to do this is to stress the fact 
that the patient can simply change her goals. That is, although there may 
not be many choices about how to achieve a goal, she can choose her own 
life goals. The catch is that in choosing her goals, she also has to be prepared 
to accept what goes along with those goals. That is, she has to accept the 
natural consequences of her choices. 
Thus, the therapist should stress the patient's freedom to choose, while 
--- Page 309 ---
290 BASIC TREATMENT STRATEGIES 
at the same time presenting realistic consequences of choices clearly. For ex­
ample, in developing (or redeveloping) a patient's commitment to stop at­
tempting suicide, the therapist may emphasize that the patient is free to choose 
a life of coping by parasuicide, but that if this choice is made another therapy 
will need to be found, since DBT requires reduction of parasuicide as a goal. 
Similarly, the therapist may note that the patient is free to continue therapy-
interfering behaviors, but should also clarify the therapist's own limits if that 
choice is made. For example, I once told a patient who persisted in a particu­
larly aversive (to me) behavior pattern that she could continue the pattern, 
but that if she did I wouldn't want to work with her She immediately asked 
whether I was threatening to terminate therapy if she didn't stop. "No," I said, 
"I'm going to stay in therapy with you; I just won't like it, that's all." 
The reader may notice that both consequences have to do with the ther­
apy relationship. These are usually the most powerful consequences for this 
particular strategy, since they are the ones the therapist can be most sure about. 
As I discuss in Chapter 10, however, therapeutic contingencies depend on a 
strong relationship. Thus, they must be used with caution if the relationship 
is not yet formed. 
The therapist can look to the previous discussions of pros and cons or 
to previous analyses of outcomes of dysfunaional behaviors to get other ideas 
about likely and realistic consequences for dysfunaional behaviors. The point 
is that both therapist and patient must accept that the patient is free to choose 
these behaviors and their consequences. Highlighting this freedom whUe simul­
taneously stressing the negative consequences of faUure to make a particular 
commitment can strengthen both a commitment and the likelihood of follow-
through on the agreement. 
6. USING PRINCIPLES OF SHAPING 
It is important to keep in mind that commitments often have to be shaped. 
In the initial stages of change, commitments may be to limited goals that can 
be expanded over time. At other times, the patient may simply be tired or 
demoralized, and previous large commitments may have to be reduced for 
a time. Often the therapist will want larger commitments than the patient 
can give. The therapist must be flexible and creative in obtaining at times 
a just-noticeable difference in commitment. The ability to reduce requests 
or use the door-in-the-face technique, without at the same time making the 
patient look like a failure, is essential here. 
7. GENERATING HOPE: CHEERLEADING 
One of the major problems confronting suicidal and borderiine individuals 
is their lack of any hope that they can put solutions generated into practice, 
or that their attempts will not end in failure and humiliation. Commitment 
without hope of keeping the commitment is extremely difficult. The use of 
--- Page 310 ---
Core Strategies: Part II. Problem Solving 291 
cheerieading strategies is nowhere more important than in problem solving. 
During each problem-solving interaction (particularly as the interaaion nears 
to an end and a commitment is needed), the therapist needs to encourage 
the patient, reinforce even minimal progress on her part, and consistently point 
out that she has within her everything it will take to overcome her problems 
in the end. 
8. AGREEING ON HOMEWORK 
Assigned, structured practice of new problem solutions or new behavioral 
skills is an integral part of the psychoeducational skills training groups. Struc­
tured homework assignments are not typical of individual therapy. However, 
the patient and therapist may often agree on specific behaviors that the pa­
tient wUl try between one session and the next. In such an instance, the ther­
apist should be sure to write down the behavioral "assignment." It is also very 
important not to forget to ask about it during the next session. At times it 
may be useful for the patient to write down what she is going to do as well. 
If a task is very difficult, the therapist may ask the patient to check in during 
the week to report on progress or unexpected difficulties. 
Concluding Comments 
The problem-solving strategies in DBT are no different from those used in 
most forms of cognitive-behavioral therapy. If they were sufficient unto them­
selves, of course, there would be little need to develop a specific treatment 
for BPD. A major difference between these strategies with borderline patients 
and applying them with other patients is that with the former, the therapist 
must be prepared to repeat each step many times. Commitments made must 
be remade. The same insight may need to be repeated almost endlessly be­
fore it sinks in. Behavioral analysis can be time-consuming and tedious, es­
pecially when the process is punctuated by repeated therapy-interfering 
behaviors. Altemative behaviors and soloutions that seem possible to the ther­
apist can seem impossible to the patient. Generally, skills training, applica­
tion of contingencies, cognitive modification, and exposure-based procedures 
aimed at reducing interfering emotionality are needed, singly or in combina­
tion, to help the patient put into practice problem solutions that the ther­
apist and patient have developed together These procedures are discussed 
in detail in the next two chapters.

Change Procedures: 
Part I. Contingency Procedures 
(Managing Contingencies and 
Observing Limits) 
C I hange procedures — contingency 
procedures, behavioral skills training, exposure-based procedures, and cog­
nitive modification—are interwoven throughout DBT. They are used by all 
therapists, although the mix will vary with treatment modality and phase of 
therapy. Application of the procedures is linked to four main groups of ques­
tions addressed in behavioral analysis. The relationship of these groups of 
questions to particular procedures can be seen in Table 10.1. Each type of 
procedure is used briefly and informally in almost every therapeutic interac­
tion; they can also be used in a structured and formal way. 
Examples of formal contingency procedures include such things as im­
plementing a self-conscious treatment plan that specifies consequences for 
particular behaviors (e.g., the DBT rule that a patient cannot call the ther­
apist for 24 hours following parasuicide, or a decision that if a patient phones 
over X times one week she loses the opportunity to call the therapist the next 
week); implementing level and privilege systems on inpatient units; or using 
"canned" or organized self-management programs between sessions. More 
informally, and often with little reflection, every therapist response observed 
or experienced by the patient (i.e., public behaviors of the therapist) can be 
either neutral, punishing, or reinforcing. Thus, every contingent response is 
an informal contingency procedure, skillful or not. Making direct changes 
in the environment to support new or more effective behavior is also an ex­
ample of using contingency procedures. 
An important point in the application of change procedures is that

whenever possible, learning should occur in the context in which new behav­
iors are needed. For instance, learning to inhibit suicidal behavior on an inpa­
tient unit and to replace it with distress tolerance and emotion regulation skills 
is not very useful if the new skills do not generalize to other environments 
and situations, particularly crisis situations. SimUarly, learning to interaa ap­
propriately with a therapist is not a useful skiU if it does not generalize to inter­
actions in other relationships. In DBT, the emphasis is on keeping patients 
in problem or crisis situations while simultaneously teaching them new prob­
lem solutions and trauma coping strategies. Learning crisis survival skills (an 
important focus of distress tolerance training), for example, is difficult if the 
patient is removed from a crisis whenever the situation appears overwhelm­
ing to the therapist. This topic is discussed extensively in Chapter 15 in con­
nection with the DBT telephone sttategies and hospital protocol. Here, the 
therapist simply needs to keep in mind that either learning has to take place 
in the context where new behaviors are needed, or, if not, special efforts must 
be made to insure that learning generalizes to those situations. 
--- Page 313 ---
294 BASIC TREATMENT STRATEGIES 
The Rationale for Contingency Procedures 
Although DBT theory emphasizes skill deficits, motivational faaors are clearly 
important in the application of skills a patient does have. Thus, DBT balances 
a deficit model such as that of Kohut (1977, 1984) or Adler (1985, 1989) 
with a motivational model such as that of Kernberg (1984) or Masterson 
(1976). Even when borderline patients have the requisite skills for a particu­
lar situation, they often do not employ them. The difference here is between 
skill acquisition and skill performance. In DBT, motivational issues are ana­
lyzed in terms of environmental and person factors currently influencing and 
controUing the behaviors in question. Identifying these faaors is a major focus 
of behavioral analysis. 
Contingency procedures in DBT are based on a simple premise: The con­
sequences of a behavior affea the probabUity of the behavior's occturing again. 
The aim is to harness the power of therapeutic contingencies to benefit the 
patient. At a minimum, contingency procedures require the therapist to care­
fully monitor and organize his or her own interpersonal behavior with the 
patient, so that behaviors targeted for change are not inadvertently reinforced 
while positive, adaptive behaviors are punished. "First, do no harm." Fur­
thermore, when possible, the therapist should arrange outcomes so that skUlful 
behaviors are reinforced and unskillful or maladaptive behaviors are replaced 
or extinguished. This is necessarily a delicate and somewhat hazardous balance 
in the case of suicidal behaviors, as the therapist attempts neither to rein­
force suicidal responses excessively nor to ignore them in such a manner that 
the patient escalates these responses to a life-threatening level. This approach 
requires the therapist to take some short-term risks to achieve long-term gains. 
"Reinforcement" here is defined in its technical sense as referring to all 
consequences or contingencies that increase or strengthen the probability of 
behavior The definition is actually a funaional one, that is, an event is only 
a reinforcer if it functions as one; thus, separate identification of concrete 
reinforcers is necessary for each person. This point cannot be overempha­
sized and is discussed in more detail later Although reinforcers are typically 
thought of as positive, desirable, or rewarding events, they need not be. Koh­
lenberg and Tsai (1991), for example, point out that a dentist's being avail­
able for appointments strengthens the behavior of making a dental 
appointment (over going for dental work without an appointment), even for 
the person who hates to go to the dentist. In contrast to reinforcement proce­
dures, extinction and punishment weaken or decrease the probabUity of be­
havior "Extinction" is the cessation of reinforcement for a behavior that was 
previously reinforced. "Punishment" is the application of consequences that 
suppress the probability of behavior; any consequence that functions as a 
punishment is, by definition, "aversive." Although both procedures weaken 
or eliminate behavior, the way each works is markedly different. These differ­
ences are very important for the therapeutic enterprise. 
In principle, DBT favors the use of reinforcement procedures, or rein-
--- Page 314 ---
Change Procedures: Part I. Contingency Procedures 295 
forcement plus extinction, over either punishment or extinction used alone. 
Ideally, as noted above, the therapist tries to arrange things so that unskilled 
and maladaptive behaviors are replaced by incompatible skillful behaviors 
that have become more reinforcing for the individual. Ideal conditions, 
however, are not usual with borderline patients; as a result, either extinction 
or aversive consequences are necessary at times. 
Contingency procedures in DBT, especially the use of aversive conse­
quences, are very similar to procedures for setting limits in other therapeutic 
approaches. As usually defined, "setting limits" refers to the therapist's ac­
tivities that punish or threaten loss of reinforcers for behaviors the therapist 
believes are harmful to the patient. "Limits" refers in this context to the limits 
of acceptable behavior Usually, but not always, the behaviors limited are those 
that the therapist believes are maladaptive and out of the patient's control, 
or those that seriously interfere with therapy. DBT defines "limits" more nar­
rowly and makes a distinction between limit-relevant and target-relevant be­
haviors (see below); however, again, the actual procedures used in DBT are 
quite similar to limit-setting procedures used in other types of therapy. 
The Distinction Between Managing 
Contingencies and Observing Limits 
There are two types of contingency procedures in DBT, addressing two types 
of behaviors. The first category, "contingency management," address the be­
haviors on the DBT priority target Hst as well as behaviors functionally re­
lated to them. Taken together, these can be considered "target-relevant 
behaviors"— a term very close in meaning to the term "clinically relevant be­
haviors," coined by Kohlenberg and Tsai (1991). Although including function­
ally related behaviors certainly can open Pandora's box, the targeted behaviors 
are clearly specified at the beginning of therapy (in principle, at least). The 
patient chooses to work on these behaviors by choosing to enter DBT. In long-
term therapy, once behavioral patterns high in the hierarchy of targets have 
been remediated, target-relevant behaviors may consist primarily of patterns 
of behavior chosen by the patient. That is, they may reflect the seventh DBT 
target, the patient's individual goals. The sole faaors deciding target-relevant 
behaviors are the welfare and long-range goals of the patient. 
The second category, "observing limits," addresses all patient behaviors 
that push or cross the therapist's own personal limits. Taken together, these 
behaviors can be considered "limit-relevant behaviors." The patient's welfare 
and wishes are not the primary and deciding faaors in this instance. Instead, 
the deciding factor is the relationship of the patient's behaviors to the ther­
apist's own personal limits. Thus, limit-relevant behaviors will differ across 
therapists; behaviors targeted by one therapist wUl not necessarily be targeted 
by another 
DBT strongly emphasizes differentiating these two types of behaviors in 
using contingency procedures. Observing limits is a special category of DBT 
--- Page 315 ---
296 BASIC TREATMENT STRATEGIES 
contingency procedures, in which the focus is on therapists' limits and pa­
tients' behaviors relevant to them. Limits, both for borderline patients and 
for their therapists, are often enormously controversial. The observing-Iimits 
approach has been developed to deal equitably and effeaively with problems 
in this area; it differs somewhat from limit-setting approaches in many other 
therapies, however 
The Therapeutic Relationship as Contingency 
For most borderline patients, the most powerful reinforcers usuaUy have to 
do with the quality of the therapeutic relationship. With some patients, little 
else is powerful enough to counteract the reinforcing effects already in place 
for destruaive and maladaptive behavior. Thus, contingency procedures are 
almost impossible to use before a strong relationship has developed between 
patient and therapist. A strong relationship enhances the valence of the ther­
apist's behaviors, which are then used unabashedly in DBT to reinforce pa­
tient behavior In sum, development of a strong and intense interpersonal 
relationship with the patient is essential. It is not that other reinforcers are 
unavailable, but that most other ones are either too weak or counter the rein­
forcing outcomes of patients' problem behaviors or not under the control of 
the therapist. 
Once a strong positive relationship has been developed the most effec­
tive reinforcer available to the therapist is expression and continuation of the 
positive relationship. The most effeaive punishment is withdrawal of the ther­
apist's warmth, good will, and/or approval (or, at times, withdrawal of ther­
apy altogether). The relationship is used in the service of the patient's long-term 
goals. (In the vernacular used in Chapter 4, the therapist first develops a sttong 
positive relationship and then uses it to "blackmaU" the patient into making 
targeted, but excruciatingly difficult, changes in her behavior) Two points 
are very important here. First, the therapist cannot use relationship contin­
gencies before a strong, positive relationship is formed. "You have to get the 
money in the bank before you can spend it," so to speak. Second, since DBT 
also stresses natural over arbitrary contingencies (discussed below), the 
strength, if not the intensity, of the relationship has to be mutual. That is, 
a phony or less than genuine attachment of the therapist to the patient leads 
necessarily to arbitrary or less than genuine responses. (Maintaining a genuine 
liking for the patient is one target of the therapist supervision/consultation 
strategies discussed in Chapter 13.) Far from ignoring or downplaying the 
therapeutic relationship, DBT stresses the strength of the relationship. 
For many therapists, the notion of using interpersonal warmth, attach­
ment, and so forth as reinforcers may seem incompatible with genuinely car-
mg for a patient. For some, the very idea feels manipulative. For others, genuine 
caring means staying warm and attached no matter what the other person 
does. As with most controversies, there is truth to both sides. On the one 
--- Page 316 ---

hand, in most relationships people naturaUy reinforce prosocial, adaptive be­
haviors and withhold reinforcement foUowing negative or disliked behaviors. 
When a husband lies or steals, for instance, a loving wife does not immedi­
ately express approval and warmth. A person does not usuaUy respond to 
a hostile verbal attack by spending more time with the attacker Other types 
of human relationships differ from a therapeutic relationship not in how posi­
tive behaviors are responded to, but rather in who is benefiting from the posi­
tive behavior and the explicitness of the use of contingencies. In the therapy 
relationship, behaviors that benefit the patient are reinforced, and the use of 
contingencies is intentional and self-conscious. In most other relationships 
(particularly peer relationships), the benefit of both parties is equally impor­
tant in determining what behaviors will be reinforced, and contingencies are 
used in an un-self-conscious way. 
On the other hand, use of interpersonal contingencies should not be an 
excuse for withholding warmth, attachment, intimacy, approval, and valida­
tion from a relationship-deprived patient. Minute for minute, even the most 
difficult patient is usually engaging in far more positive, adaptive behaviors 
than problematic behaviors. Simply coming to a therapy session and sticking 
it out constitute an accomplishment for many. Indeed, the deprived lives of 
many borderline individuals suggest that therapists should attempt to pro­
vide as much interpersonal dependability, nurturance, and care as possible. 
That is, they should search for opportunities to reinforce the patients; more 
simply put, therapists must love their patients, giving them what they need 
to flourish and grow, and perhaps a bit more. Nor should the criteria for 
warmth and approval be set too high. The slightest misstep cannot occasion 
catastrophic loss. I discuss this point more fully below in connection with 
principles of shaping. 
CONTINGENCY MANAGEMENT PROCEDURES 
Every response within an interpersonal interaaion is a potential form of rein­
forcement, punishment, or extinction. This is no less true in psychotherapy 
than in any other relationship, and holds true whether the therapist and pa­
tient intend it or not. How the therapist responds to the patient from mo­
ment to moment, affeas what the patient subsequently does, feels, thinks, 
and senses. Contingency management strategies are ways to manage the con­
tingent relationships between the patient's behavior and the therapist's 
responses so that the ultimate outcomes are beneficial instead of iatrogenic. 
The most important are reviewed in this seaion and summarized in Table 10.2.

T reinforces behaviors already in P's repertoire that are in the direction

T pushes P to just below the limit of her capability; task difficulty re­
quired for reinforcement is just a little bit more difficult than what 
P has already accomplished. 
When P behaves near the limit of her capability, T reinforces behavior 
T does not reinforce (T extinguishes) behaviors far from the goal be­
havior when behaviors more similar to it are within P's capability. 
T uses information about all variables in a situation (including those 
that impinge on P's current vulnerability) to grade difficulty of task. 
Anti-DBT tactics 
T "gives in" to P's demands and reinforces behaviors well below P's capabilities 
when more capable behavior is required in the situation at hand. 
T is inconsistent in use of contingency management procedures. 
T is punitive in use of aversive consequences. 
T requires behaviors beyond P's capabilities before reinforcing behavioral attempt. 
sionals alike, about principles of reinforcement and their effects on behavior 
makes this task both extra important and extra difficult. Getting across ac­
curate information about how learning works is crucial if the patient is to 
collaborate in discovering the forces controlling her own behavior It goes 
without saying that the therapist has to be fully famiHar with principles of 
learning; most general textbooks on behavior modification or behavior ther­
apy wiU have a summary of these principles (e.g., Martin & Pear, 1992; 
Masters et al., 1987; Millenson & Leslie, 1979; O'Leary & WUson, 1987). 
The therapist also has to work at reducing the stigma of socially unaccepta­
ble patterns of reinforcement. In my experience, the following points (in any 
order) are the most helpful ones to make. 
First, the therapist should discuss the differences among intentions, be­
havioral planning, purpose, and consequences as they influence how individu­
als respond or aa in the worid. With borderiine patients, this is a particularly 
sensitive point. The intent of their behaviors is frequentiy unrelated to at least 
some of the outcomes, including outcomes that reinforce the behaviors. The 
therapist should point out to the patient (as I have pointed out throughout 
this book) that is it an error in logic to assume that the consequences of be­
havior necessarily prove intent. Many consequences are in fact unintended. 
Moreover, the fact that a consequence strengthens behavior (i.e., is a rein­
forcer) does not mean that the consequence was intended or wanted; unin­
tended consequences can and frequently do reinforce behavior 
Second, the therapist should discuss the automatic nature of most learn­
ing. Examples that can be used include infant and animal learning, in which 
conscious or unconscious intent is usually not ascribed. The physical effeas 
--- Page 319 ---
300 BASIC TREATMENT STRATEGIES 
of reinforcement on the brain, independent of what a person may intend or 
want, can also be discussed. Reinforcing consequences cause chemical changes 
in the brain; neural circuits are changed. 
Third, the therapist should point out that consequences can affect be­
havior without a person's awareness. In fact, most of us are not aware of how 
and when behavioral consequences influence our behavior Thus, the faa that 
we "feel" as if we are doing something for one reason or purpose does not 
necessarily mean that this reason or purpose is actually influencing our be­
havior All humans (not just "mental patients") tend to construct reasons for 
their own behavior when "causes" are not apparent (Nisbett & WUson, 1977). 
An example of this would be as follows. In animals, research has shown that 
stimulating certain reward centers in the brain increases the frequency of any 
behavior immediately preceding the stimulation. In faa, the effea is so power­
ful that an animal can be made to engage in a "rewarded" behavior so fre­
quently that it will not stop to eat even when food-deprived. (This research 
is summarized in Millenson & Leslie, 1979.) In humans, if there were a way 
to contingently stimulate the reward center in the brain, it would also increase 
the immediately preceding behaviors. If a person knew that this was being 
done, he or she would, of course, explain the increased behavior as due to 
the stimulation. But what if there were a way to stimulate a person's reward 
center in the brain without his or her knowledge? If this stimulation could 
be made contingent on some particular behavior, the behavior would increase, 
but the person would not know that the stimulation was influencing it. In 
this circumstance, normal people will make up a rational reason, unrelated 
to brain stimulation (e.g., "I like doing it"), to explain their own behavior 
The therapist can give an example of when he or she has "constructed" a 
reason for behavior that was later found to be influenced by something else 
entirely, and then solicit examples from the patient. 
Fourth, the therapist should note that when a person figures out what 
is influencing his or her behavior, this is called "insight." It is unlikely that 
insight into socially unacceptable behavior reinforcement patterns will be 
achieved if therapist and patient collude in assuming that intent, consequences, 
and reinforcement go necessarily hand in hand, or that "feelings" or beHefs 
about causes (without supporting data) are always the best information about 
what is really influencing behavior When both patient and therapist formu­
late reinforcement principles in this manner, they work against observing and 
identifying the contingent relationships that influence behavior 
Fifth, it is very helpful to give a lesson on the effects of extinction on 
behavior If necessary, the therapist can explain to the patient how maladap­
tive behaviors may temporarily increase in frequency or intensity after removal 
of reinforcement. Understanding these effects sometimes mitigates the pain 
associated with removal of usual reinforcers. The foot-in-the-door technique, 
described in Chapter 9, can be used to help the patient make a commitment 
to tolerating the painful aspects of changing contingencies. 
Finally, principles of punishment, discussed below, should be reviewed 
--- Page 320 ---
Change Procedures: Part I. Contingency Procedures 301 
with the patient. This information serves several purposes besides simple orien­
tation. It provides a rationale for the patient's deciding to drop punishment 
as a self-control technique. As I have mentioned several times previously, self-
punishment is sometimes the only self-control procedures used by borderline 
individuals. In addition, providing information on the time-limited and nega­
tive effects of punishment increases that patient's power in the therapeutic 
relationship, and gives her a "weapon" to use in trying to stop unwise use 
of coercion by the therapist. 
The classes of behavior targeted for reinforcement (e.g., distress toler­
ance, mindfulness) and for extinction and punishment (e.g., threatening sui­
cide, attacking the therapist) will have been discussed as part of the initial 
and continuing assessment and treatment planning. The principles discussed 
above, and others discussed more fully later in this chapter, should ordinari­
ly be reviewed with the patient during the initial orientation to therapy. Re­
orientation may also be needed when patient and therapist are attempting 
to figure out what is maintaining a particular pattern of behavior The prin­
ciples may need further review when major new contingencies are being ap­
plied to the patient's behavior However, it is not necessary or particularly 
helpful for the therapist to explain why, what, or how contingencies are be­
ing implemented in every single instance. To do this would so remove the 
pattern of contingencies from that used in everyday life that generalization 
might be seriously compromised. This is a particularly important issue when 
extinaion and punishment are being used; it is discussed in more detail 
below. 
I. REINFORCING TARGET-RELEVANT ADAPTIVE BEHAVIORS 
A central principle of DBT is that therapists should reinforce target-relevant 
adaptive behaviors when they occur The therapist must at all times pay at­
tention to (1) what the patient is doing; (2) whether the patient's behavior 
is targeted for increase, is targeted for decrease, or is irrelevant to current aims 
(i.e., whether the behavior is target-relevant); and (3) how he or she responds 
to the patient behaviors. In Kohlenberg and Tsai's (1991) terms, the therapist 
must observe clinically relevant behaviors and reinforce those behaviors that 
represent progress. Two important principles of reinforcement are proper tim­
ing and proper scheduling. 
Timing of Reinforcement 
Immediate reinforcement is far more powerful than delayed reinforcement. 
This is why so many behaviors are extraordinarily difficult to decrease: They 
result in short-term, immediate reinforcement. Often, however, these same 
behaviors lead to long-term negative or punishing outcomes. Addiaive be­
haviors are a good example here. The immediate reinforcing effects of drugs, 
alcohol, gambling, food, and often suicidal behaviors as well, strengthen the 
--- Page 321 ---
302 BASIC TREATMENT STRATEGIES 
behaviors far more effectively than long-term aversive consequences weaken 
them. Thus, it is important for the therapist to reinforce improved behavior as 
soon as possible. Behaviors occurring in the therapist's presence, or during 
telephone conversations are much more available for immediate reinforcement. 
Thus, it is important to be alert to improvement during therapy interactions. 
Scheduling of Reinforcement 
At the beginning of therapy, continuous reinforcement may be needed. If posi­
tive behaviors occur at a low rate, almost every instance should be reinforced 
in some manner. Once the patient is emitting skilled behaviors at a high rate, 
the therapist can begin to fade the reinforcement schedule gradually, and can 
then phase it out altogether. Behaviors that are intermittently reinforced are 
far more resistant to extinction. However, the therapist should be alert to 
precipitous drops in reinforcement frequency and to long periods of little or 
no reinforcement. In such instances, the therapist should examine his or her 
own attentiveness to positive events or attitudes toward the patient. 
Validation, Responsiveness, and Nondemanding 
Attentiveness as Reinforcers 
How to reinforce a borderline patient can be exceptionally complex. For some 
patients, expressions of warmth and closeness are very effective; for others, 
such expressions are so threatening that their effea is just the opposite of 
that intended. Although a central procedure in DBT is to develop a positive 
relationship and then use that relationship to reinforce progress, how close 
the therapist and patient are to actually having such a relationship determines 
which therapist behaviors are likely to reinforce and which are likely to pun­
ish. How to determine the potency of consequences is discussed below. 
For most (but certainly not all) borderline patients, the following rela­
tionship behaviors are reinforcing: (1) expressions of the therapist's approval, 
care, concern, and interest; (2) behaviors that communicate liking or admir­
ing the patient (see cautions below on use of praise), wanting to work with 
her, and wanting to interact with her; (3) behaviors that reassure the patient 
that the therapist is dependable and the therapy is secure; (4) almost any 
validating response (except, at times, cheerieading); (5) behaviors that are 
responsive to the patient's requests and inputs; and (6) attention from or con­
tact with the therapist (e.g., getting regular or extra appointments, being able 
to phone the therapist between sessions, having longer or shorter sessions 
as the patient desires). 
2. EXTINGUISHING TARGET-RELEVANT 
MALADAPTIVE BEHAVIORS 
Behavioral responses are extinguished when the reinforcers that maintain the 
behavior are removed. The therapist must determine what reinforcers are in 
--- Page 322 ---
Change Procedures: Part I. Contingency Procedures 303 
fact maintaining a particular maladaptive behavior pattern, and then system­
atically withhold those reinforcers following the behavior All other things 
being equal, a therapist should not reinforce high-priority, maladaptive be­
haviors once they have been targeted for extinction. The therapist should keep 
in mind that specific priorities for contingency management are determined 
by the target hierarchy and by the principles of shaping discussed below. Once 
a behavior is put on an extinction schedule, however, the therapist should 
not abandon the extinaion program even if higher-priority target behaviors 
emerge. 
Because extinction procedures can be misused so easily, it can be useful 
to remember that not aU behaviors are maintained by their consequences. Some 
behaviors are, instead, elicited automatically by prior events. For example, 
take the baby who cries when stuck by a pin and then stops crying when 
the pin is pulled out. Is it reasonable to assume that pulling pins out of babies 
maintains (reinforces) crying? Perhaps, but it is more reasonable to assume 
that crying is automatically elicited by the pinprick. Rather than leaving the 
pin stuck in the baby so as not to reinforce crying, the sensible thing to do 
is to remove the pin. (From the point of view of "contingencies of survival," 
however, it may be just this contingency that caused humans to develop auto­
matic crying following painful events in the first place. Babies who cry or 
yelp when in pain or danger are more likely to be taken care of, and thus 
have an increased potential to survive infancy and pass on their genes.) There 
simply is no substitute for a good behavioral analysis to determine what is, 
in fact, maintaining the maladaptive behavior in question. (This point, 
especially as it applies to suicidal behavior, is discussed more fully in Chap­
ter 15.) 
Nonetheless, much of human behavior, including many maladaptive be­
haviors of borderline patients, are maintained by their consequences. The idea 
of withholding reinforcement following a behavior targeted for extinaion may 
seem simple and obvious, but it can be enormously difficult to carry out in 
praaice, especially with suicidal patients. The reason for the difficulty is that 
many behaviors targeted for extinction are under the control of two types 
of consequences relevant to therapy: They result in reinforcing interpersonal 
outcomes, and/or they provide escape from aversive situations. Interpersonally, 
such behaviors may funaion to communicate, to get help, to maintain close­
ness (or distance), to obtain resources the person needs or wants, to get 
revenge, and so on. In addition, the behaviors often distract the patient from 
or put an end to painful events or interaaions. A borderline patient's problem 
behaviors often funaion quite effeaively. Mental health professionals (includ­
ing previous therapists), family members, and other intimates have often in­
advertently reinforced, usually on an intermittent schedule, the very behaviors 
the current therapist and the patient are trying to eliminate. 
For example, a patient may beg to be hospitalized because she feels too 
overwhelmed to cope. If the therapist refuses because he or she believes that 
the patient can cope, but then reconsiders when she threatens to kill herself 
--- Page 323 ---
304 BASIC TREATMENT STRATEGIES 
if she is not hospitalized, this will inadvertently (and usually without aware­
ness of either the patient or the therapist) increase the probability and inten­
sity of future suicidal urges and threats. If a helpless stance or out-of-control 
emotionality leads the therapist to pay more attention or give more help to 
the patient than when she asks for what she wants directly and competently, 
this will reinforce the helplessness and emotionality the therapist is trying 
to reduce. If in the middle of discussing a difficult or painful topic the pa­
tient is trying to avoid, the therapist switches topics or becomes solicitous 
when the patient dissociates, depersonalizes, or engages in personal attacks, 
dissociating, depersonalizing, and personal attacks (all other things being 
equal) can be counted on to increase. 
By contrast, if the therapist does not reinforce these behaviors, this ef­
feaively puts the patient on an extinction schedule. Doing so has several 
prediaable consequences. First, although in time the behavior can be expeaed 
to decrease, there will be a "behavioral burst" near the beginning of extinc­
tion and intermittently thereafter Extinaion has the paradoxical effect of 
temporarily increasing the strength, intensity, and frequency of behavior Se­
cond, if the behavior previously funaioned to meet an important need of the 
person or to terminate very aversive states, and if the patient has no other 
behaviors that work as well, the therapist can expect the patient's general be­
havior to become somewhat disorganized or intense. The person may search 
for other equivalent behaviors that will work; if these fail also, the person 
may react with extreme emotion and thinking, and behavior may become 
chaotic. 
How the therapist responds to these reaaions is critical. When a behavior 
is noxious for the therapist, or the therapist fears irrevocable harm to the pa­
tient, it is very tempting to decide to stop the extinction procedure temporar­
ily. In the examples given above, it is very difficult to maintain the positions 
of not hospitalizing the patient who threatens suicide; of not giving more at­
tention, help, and concem when the patient is out of control; and of not with­
drawing and reorienting the treatment session when the patient dissociates, 
depersonalizes, or attacks. Although these responses may at times be neces­
sary, and may result in short-term gain, their effect on the patient's long-term 
welfare may be iatrogenic. If these responses are indeed reinforcers for that 
particular patient, the behavior targeted for extinction is made even more resis­
tant to extinction, and thus more likely to show up in the future. In addition, 
if the timing of a reinforcing response follows a behavioral burst or disor­
ganized, extreme, or chaotic behavior this also makes the behavior worse. 
When the behavior in question is suicidal behavior, this can indeed be unfor­
tunate: The individual can escalate such behavior only so far before she ends 
up dead. 
Various factors may increase the likelihood of the therapist's breaking 
the extinaion schedule. When the patient has previously been rewarded for 
persistence and very extreme responses, the patient may simply wear out the 
therapist. This is most likely when a therapist is tired, is overextended, and 
--- Page 324 ---
Change Procedures: Part I. Contingency Procedures 305 
has not observed his or own limits. Breaking the schedule and appeasement 
is also likely when the therapist is unsure of his or her treatment plan, has 
not properly assessed the behavior, or feels guilty about not giving the pa­
tient what she apparently wants and needs. Appeasement usually occurs when 
the extinction process leads to a greater display of pain than the therapist 
can handle, or the therapist feels threatened by the patient's behavior (e.g., 
when the therapist fears that the patient will commit suicide or otherwise 
substantially harm herself). Borderline patients frequently threaten suicide if 
a therapist does not do something to reduce their pain. "Giving in" reduces 
the threat and the pain display, and soothes therapist and patient alike. 
The therapist can do a number of things to ease the extinaion process 
for patient and therapist alike. It is important to do so, because otherwise, 
one or both parties may simply quit the enterprise. An extinction schedule 
should be aimed at the targeted behavior, not at the individual herself. The 
aim is to break the relationship between the targeted behavior and reinforc­
ing consequences; this aim is not necessarily to deprive the individual of those 
consequences completely. Two strategies are useful here: finding other be­
haviors to reinforce, and soothing. 
1. Finding another response to reinforce. The first strategy is to get the 
patient to engage in some behavior that can be reinforced in place of the be­
havior being extinguished. According to the principles of shaping (discussed 
below), the idea is to get the patient to do something just a little bit better 
than usual and then to move in quickly with reinforcement. With a border­
line patient this may require much use of problem solving, and considerable 
patience, but usually some positive or improved behavior will result if ther­
apist and patient persist. (At least, it wUl once the patient learns that the ther­
apist is not a person likely to give in and reinforce behaviors that both have 
agreed must stop.) The long-term task is to associate adaptive problem-solving 
behaviors with more reinforcing outcomes than those linked to maladaptive 
behaviors. 
2. Soothing. With a patient on an extinaion schedule, it is crucial for 
the therapist to validate the importance of her getting what she wants and 
needs, and to acknowledge solicitously how difficult the therapy process is. 
The problem rarely is in what she wants or needs but in how she goes about 
getting it. Thus, the therapist must combine extinaion with a heavy dose 
of soothing and kindness. This can be particularly difficult for therapists, 
especially those who feel guilty about not giving patients what they want. 
Some therapists cope with their own painful emotions by closing themselves 
off emotionally from their patients; that is, they behave in a somewhat bor­
derline fashion themselves —all or none. One possible tactic is to come up 
with a way to suffer along with the patient, meanwhile continuing the ex­
tinction. (A father who tells a child he is spanking that the spanking hurts 
him more than the chUd is an example here.) Orienting, didactic, and com­
mitment strategies can also be applied. A patient often experiences extinc-
--- Page 325 ---
306 BASIC TREATMENT STRATEGIES 
tion as arbitrary and emotionaUy withholding; explainmg why it is being used, 
and working on a recommitment to work on the targeted behavior, can be 
helpful. 
The bottom line is threefold. First, once a patient is placed on an extinc­
tion schedule, the therapist has to find the courage and commitment to stick 
to it. Second, when extinguishing behaviors that are funaional for the in­
dividual, the therapist must help the patient find other, more adaptive behav­
iors that wUl function as weU or better and be sure to reinforce those behaviors. 
Third, when putting a patient on an extinction schedule, the therapist must 
soothe her through it. Extinction is not a means of punishing patients. 
3. USING AVERSIVE CONSEQUENCES...WITH CARE 
When to Use Aversive Consequences 
As I have noted above, punishment is the pairing of a behavioral response 
with an aversive consequence. Doing something to the patient that she doesn't 
want and taking away something she does want, for example, are aversive 
consequences for most people. As with reinforcement, however, the effect of 
any specific consequence depends on the particular situation, the particular 
behavior targeted, and other contextual characteristics. An event that is aver­
sive in one context or situation may not be aversive in another. Once again, 
as with reinforcement, the definition of punishment is a functional or 
procedural one, and an event or outcome is labeled "aversive" (and the whole 
procedure is labeled "punishment") only if it acts to suppress behaviors in 
the specific case. 
The difference between extinction and punishment is sometimes subtle 
but important. In extinaion, the consequence that is reinforcing the behavior 
is removed; in punishment, positive conditions previously unrelated to the 
response are removed (or aversive conditions are added). For example, if 
parasuicide on an inpatient unit is reinforced by staff attention, ignoring the 
patient after parasuicidal behavior is extinaion; taking away desired privUeges 
or publicly humiliating her is punishment. 
At times, aversive consequences are the only way to eliminate targeted 
maladaptive behaviors. They are used in DBT in two instances. First, they 
are used when the consequences reinforcing a target-relevant, high-priority 
behavior are not under the control of the therapist and no other stronger 
reinforcers are available. That is, the behavior cannot be put on an extinction 
schedule, nor can incompatible alternative behavior be reinforced. For ex­
ample, "borderiine" behaviors may immediately and effectively reduce or ter­
minate painful emotions, thoughts and situations or create pleasant ones; resuk 
in desired inpatient admissions (or discharges) or money from public as­
sistance; provide a way out of a difficult task; or elicit validation and expres­
sions of care or concern from others. When these reinforcers cannot be con-
--- Page 326 ---
Change Procedures: Part I. Contingency Procedures 307 
trolled by the therapist and are more powerful than any equivalent reinforc­
ers the therapist has at his or her disposal, the application of aversive conse­
quences may be necessary. Second, aversive consequences are used when a 
maladaptive behavior interferes with all other adaptive behaviors—in other 
words, when no other behaviors occur that can be reinforced. This is partic­
ularly likely when the situation elicits the problem behavior more or less au­
tomatically. For example, a patient in our program was at times so hostUe 
toward her therapist that no therapeutic work could be accomplished. The 
behavior appeared to be an automatic, conditioned response to certain topics 
brought up in therapy. Once it began, however, the hostile behavior was so 
pervasive that little or no positive behavior was emitted that could be rein­
forced. In this instance, the therapist responded by ending sessions early if 
the patient could not conttol her hostile, attacking behavior within 20 minutes. 
Disappmval, Confrontation, and Withdrawal of Warmth 
as Aversive Consequences 
Criticism, confrontation, and withdrawal of therapist approval and warmth 
can be extremely aversive for the average borderline patient. (See below for 
further cautions in determining the potency of consequences). Indeed, they 
can be so aversive that the therapist has to use them not only with very great 
care, but also in very low doses and very briefly. Often what the therapist 
sees as a minor criticism, for example, is experienced by the patient as not 
only a criticism of her entire way of being, but also as a threat to the continu­
ation of therapy itself. Thus, both intense shame and equally intense fears 
of abandonment may be immediate consequences. Although this may be the 
intended level of punishment some of the time, it is usually far too extreme 
for the behavior in question. Expressions of frustration or dismay can be far 
more effective than expressions of anger The therapist's anger can be so in­
tensely disturbing that the patient becomes emotionally disorganized and 
perhaps even more dysfunaional than before. (Conversely, for some patients 
the therapist's anger is actually reinforcing, since it communicates that the 
therapist "cares enough" to get angry.) In using aversive interpersonal conse­
quences, a therapist must be cautious and analyze their effeaiveness at every 
step. 
Nonetheless, with proper consideration, just enough disapproval, con­
frontation, or emotional withdrawal can be effeaive. Sometimes no other ef­
feaive response is available. There are a number of ways to present negative 
opinions and emotional reactions. The reciprocal and irreverent communi­
cation strategies, discussed at some length in Chapter 12, can be used. For 
example, the therapist may say, "When you do X, I feel or do Y" (where X 
is the problem behavior and Y is a response that the patient does not want). 
Or, more irreverently, the therapist may say to a patient who threatens to kill 
herself, "If you kill yourself I'm going to stop being your therapist." 
--- Page 327 ---
308 BASIC TREATMENT STRATEGIES 
When the therapist responds to target-relevant maladaptive behavior vnth 
disapproval, confrontation, or withdrawal of warmth, it is very important 
to restore a positive interpersonal atmosphere following any improvement the 
patient shows, even if the positive change is minimal and barely discernible. 
That is, approval, praise and interpersonal warmth should follow; otherwise, 
the patient is likely to feel (reasonably, if sometimes disproportionately) that 
no matter what she does she cannot please the therapist. At times, of course, 
a patient can engage in behaviors that are so aversive or frustrating to the 
therapist that emotional warmth simply is not immediately avaUable, even 
though the patient attempts to repair the situation. In these cases, the natur­
al consequence of the patient's behavior is longer-lasting than the patient, 
and sometimes the therapist, may wish. A good strategy here is to discuss 
the problem with the patient in an open and accepting manner The very dis­
cussion is itself a step toward relationship repair, and thus will probably rein­
force the patient's improvement. 
Correction-Overcorrection as an Aversive Consequence 
The first and most important guidelines in using aversive consequences are 
that a consequence should "fit the crime" and that the patient must have a 
way to avoid or terminate it. The "correaion-overcorrection" technique meets 
both these criteria (see Cannon, 1983, and Mackenzie-Keating & McDonald, 
1990, for reviews of this procedure). In addition, it is usually satisfying for 
the therapist. 
There are three steps in correction-overcorrection. First, following the 
occurrence of a problem behavior, the therapist withdraws a positive condi­
tion, withholds something the patient wants, or adds an aversive consequence. 
The best consequence is one that expands a natural but undesirable (from 
the patient's point of view) effect of the behavior Second, the therapist re­
quires the patient to engage in a new behavior that both corrects the effeas 
of the maladaptive behavior, and goes past that and ot^ercorrects the effects. 
Instructions are explicit; the rationale of correction-overcorrection is clearly 
stated; and positive consequences for engaging in the correction-overcorreaion 
are laid out. The required corrective behavior, is thus dialeaically related to 
the problem behavior Third, once the new "correcting-overcorrecting" be­
havior occurs the therapist immediately stops the punishment—that is, un­
does the negative conditions or stops withholding. Thus, the patient has a 
ready way to terminate the punishment. The challenge, of course, is to devise 
outcomes and overcorrection behaviors that are aversive enough while not 
at the same time trivial or unrelated to the behaviors the therapist wants to 
teach. 
The insistence in DBT that patients who engage in parasuicide between 
sessions participate in detaUed behavioral and solution analyses of the be­
havior before other topics are discussed is an example of correction-over­
correaion. The negative consequence expanded is the therapist's very natural 
--- Page 328 ---
Change Procedures: Part I. Contingency Procedures 309 
concern for the patient and eagerness to be sure that this very difficult be­
havior is stopped. If a person is so miserable that she actually commits a 
parasuicidal act, how can a responsible therapist ignore it? The therapist in­
sists on addressing the problem. The correction-overcorreaion procedures 
are the behavioral and solution analyses. Although many borderline patients 
like to discuss the problems that set off their parasuicidal behavior, very few 
Hke to discuss the events and behaviors leading up to the response; for almost 
aU, this is an aversive consequence. On the other hand, they usually have topics 
they do want to talk about. The reinforcement is the ability to talk about 
other things. A patient of mine who used to attempt suicide, overdose, and 
mutUate herself on a regular basis suddenly, after 6 months of therapy, stopped 
completely. I asked her what happened. She said she had figured out that 
if she didn't stop, she would never get to talk about anything else. 
A similar strategy is used in skills training. For example, when a patient 
has not done any homework, the therapist launches into a full-scale, very em­
pathetic analysis of what faaors inhibited or interfered with her practice. In 
a group setting, other members are encouraged to offer ideas about how to 
counteract these influences. If the patient absolutely refuses to go along, the 
therapist may switch to a fuU-scale, equally solicitous analysis of her resistance. 
One patient used to appear at skiUs training in an emotional fog, saying that 
she hadn't remembered or had been too overwhelmed to practice her skills. 
One week, after several frustrating months, she began to report and discuss 
attempts to practice. Her praaice as well as group interaaions increased, and 
before too long she was interaaing at the level of other patients. Her individual 
therapist asked what happened. She said she got tired of using up group time 
to analyze why she hadn't praaiced and figured it was easier just to do it. 
Correction-overcorreaion is an example of using both the carrot and 
the stick. Interaction with the therapist is often the carrot, and the correc­
tion-overcorrection is the stick. A patient leaving a late appointment not only 
tore things off the walls, but stole the belongings of people working at the 
clinic. She thus crossed the limits of both the therapist and clinic (a topic 
discussed further below), a clear case of therapy-interfering behavior The 
consequence was that she was required not only to restore the clinic to its 
previous state and return the stolen property, but also to improve the after-
hours security of the clinic by contributing to the cost of hiring an after-hours 
receptionist. The carrot was another appointment with her therapist. In a 
similar crossing of the limits, another patient repaired numerous holes she 
kicked in walls, repainting and sprucing up the rooms while she was at it. 
Once the holes were repaired, sessions resumed. A patient of mine (with my 
collusion) developed a pattern of calling me on the phone in the evenings, 
threatening suicide and aaing in such an abusive fashion that I started dreading 
going home and wanted to terminate therapy with her Instead, I limited my 
avaUabUity by phone to 20 minutes per week, divided between two calls. Fur­
thermore, I told her that her task was not only to correct her phone interac­
tions with me so that they would influence me to be wUling to talk to her.

but to overcorrea so that I would actually want to do so. At that point I would 
change my policy. It took her a year, but she finally succeeded. 
Vacations from Therapy as Aversive Consequences 
Another guideline in the use of punishment is that it should be just strong 
enough to work. The ultimate punishment is termination of therapy, a con­
sequence many borderline patients have experienced more than once. Many 
inpatient units and therapists have clear rules that if particular behaviors oc­
cur even once, therapy is terminated. Parasuicidal acts, especially near-lethal 
ones, are typical behaviors that automatically lead to therapy termination. 
Other examples are seeing other therapists, obtaining unauthorized admis­
sions to inpatient units, bringing weapons to therapy, attacking therapists, 
and so on. 
DBT discourages unilateral termination. It is as if a therapist says, "If 
you actually have the problems you came to therapy for, I will terminate ther­
apy." Termination of therapy also terminates any chance the therapist has of 
helping the patient make needed changes. Putting a patient on a "vacation 
from therapy" is a DBT fall-back strategy. Vacations are used for both target-
relevant and limit-relevant behaviors. Two conditions are required: (1) AU other 
contingencies have failed, and (2) the behavior or lack of behavior is so seri­
ous that it crosses the therapist's therapeutic or personal limits. "Therapeutic 
limits" are the limits within which the therapist can conduct effeaive thera­
py. A vacation can be used when the therapist believes that unless the patient 
changes her behavior, the therapist can no longer be of help; that is, the pa­
tient's behavior is interfering with therapy to such an extent that effeaive ther­
apy is not possible. "Personal limits," as noted earlier in this chapter, are the 
limits within which the therapist is wUling to work with the patient. A vaca­
tion can be instituted when the therapist is personally unwilling to continue 
unless things change. The conditions resulting in a vacation wUl differ for 
each therapist and patient. 
A "vacation" is the cessation of therapy for a specified period of time, 
or until a particular condition is met or change is made. A number of steps 
are necessary in organizing a vacation. First, the therapist must identify the 
behavior that has to change; expeaations should be clear Second, the ther­
apist must give the patient a reasonable chance to change the behavior and 
help her to do so. That is, the patient should be able to avoid the vacation. 
Third, the conditions should be presented as resulting from the therapist's 
limits as a therapist (see the discussion on observing limits, below). That is, 
the therapist needs to show some humility here, acknowledging that another 
therapist might be able to help the patient without these conditions. Fourth, 
the therapist must make it clear that once the condition or time requirement 
has been met, the patient can return to therapy. Fifth, while the patient is 
on vacation, the therapist should maintain intermittent contact by phone or 
letter, encouraging the patient to change and retum. (In the vernacular, the 
--- Page 330 ---
Change Procedures: Part I. Contingency Procedures 311 
therapist kicks the patient out and then pines for her retum.) Finally, the ther­
apist should provide a referral or backup therapist while the patient is on 
vacation. 
Here is an example. After working with a patient for some time, I came 
to believe that if she did not agree to work on reducing her excessive alcohol 
consumption, we could go no further I could not determine whether alco­
hol abuse was causing many of her remaining problems or was a result of 
them. She refused, believing that alcohol was helping more than hurting her 
I gave her 3 months to come to a different decision —to choose between me 
and alcohol, so to speak. She had to work with me on substance abuse or 
enter an alcohol treatment program. If she refused, I could not continue treat­
ment, but (and this is how a vacation differs from termination) I would take 
her back as soon as she was willing to meet my terms. She felt that she could 
not stop drinking under pressure from me. This seemed fair enough; I sug­
gested that she see someone else to help her decide for herself, and she went 
on vacation. Following a driving while intoxicated conviaion, she was or­
dered to participate in a certain number of hours a week of court-approved 
substance abuse therapy, so that she had no time to work with me. After com­
pleting the 2-year court-ordered program, she called me to resume therapy. 
Another patient was put on vacation because I felt I could not help her 
further unless she engaged in some produaive activities. Because of her se­
vere dyslexia, epilepsy, and a degenerative nerve condition, not to mention 
her 15 years of frequent psychiatric hospitalizations, she was on public as­
sistance. Her choices were at least 20 hours per week of school, a job or volun­
teer work, or a therapy vacation. I gave her 6 months to get into vocational 
counseling or school, and then 6 more months to start work or school. She 
met the first condition the day before the deadline. She did not meet the se­
cond one and went on vacation, with my suggestion that she see another ther­
apist to help her decide about continuing therapy with me. She stayed in group 
therapy and found a case manager to see her individually. She was so angry 
at me that she refused to talk to me and ended up back in a psychiatric in­
patient unit, where she tried to get the staff to call me and make me change 
my mind. Every several weeks or so, I would catch her before her group meeting 
and tell her how I missed her in individual therapy and couldn't wait until 
she organized some produaive activities. She finally did, and therapy turned 
around. 
The examples above involved the absence of patient behaviors that I 
believed were essential for the condua of therapy. What does a therapist do 
when a patient is actively engaging in high-rate behaviors destructive to ther­
apy, or the therapist's willingness to continue is exhausted (personal limits) 
and aU other change procedures have failed? A patient of one of our ther­
apists repeatedly called the therapist's home answering machine and left mes­
sages. The frequency and abusiveness of the messages had been a focus of 
contingency management for some time. In one call, the patient threatened 
not only the life of the therapist but also that of the therapist's 9-year-old 
--- Page 331 ---
312 BASIC TREATMENT STRATEGIES 
son, who just happened to be listening when the message came in. The pa­
tient's behavior clearly crossed the therapist's limits. The patient was told that 
if the behavior recurred for any reason whatsoever, she would be on vacation 
from therapy. The patient repeated the behavior and was put on vacation. 
Another therapist stepped in to help with a referral. The terms were that she 
could return to therapy if she managed to go an entire 30 days without con­
tacting the therapist or the therapist's associates in any way (by phone, mes­
sage, letter, etc.). This was the condition required to reassure the therapist 
that the patient would be able to control her behavior in the future. The con­
dition that had to be met was that the patient had to reassure the therapist 
by her behavior that continuation would not be harmful to the therapist's 
family. 
Vacations following adverse behaviors should only be used when the be­
haviors actually interfere with the conduct of therapy. One way to remember 
this is that the patient's behavior and the punishment should, when possible, 
occur in the same system, arena, or context. If behaviors interfere with ther­
apy, therapy should be stopped. As in the dialeaical technique of extending, 
(see Chapter 7) the therapist extends or exaggerates the normal consequences 
of the patient's behavior The therapist also needs to know how aversive a 
vacation will be. For some patients, having to miss a week or two of therapy 
following dysfunctional behaviors is actuaUy reinforcing; they feel too ashamed 
to come anyway. Obviously, such patients should not be put on brief vaca­
tions. For others, even a 1 week vacation is highly aversive and is sufficient 
to affect their behavior Or a partial vacation, such as no phone calls for a 
specified period of time (if, say, the patient is making abusive calls), may be 
sufficient. Generally, if the behavior pattern is extreme and all else has faded 
(including brief vacations), the therapist should consider putting the patient 
on vacation until the end of the contracted period. At that point, the patient 
should be allowed to return to renegotiate a new contract for therapy with 
the therapist. In DBT, only one situation requires a vacation until the end 
of the contract: missing 4 scheduled weeks of therapy in a row (see Chapter 
4 for a discussion of this rule). 
Termination from Therapy. . .as an Aversive Last Resort 
As in a marriage or family relationship, any permanent breakup is regarded 
as a last resort in DBT. However, under some conditions termination is un­
avoidable or even advisable. At the beginning of therapy, before a strong rela­
tionship is formed, a therapist may terminate if he or she believes that another 
therapist would be more helpful. Obviously, this is only an option if another 
therapist is available. In later stages of the relationship, DBT should be ter­
minated before the end of the contracted period only after every available 
option for saving the relationship has been pursued, including resolute atten­
tion to therapy-interfering behaviors, outside consultation or "couples" coun­
seling, and vacations. The idea is to treat behaviors that cause burnout before 
--- Page 332 ---
Change Procedures: Part I. Contingency Procedures 313 
burnout occurs. However, if burnout does occur, despite one's best efforts, 
the situation may be irretrievable; that is, the therapist may not be able to 
recover In such a case, it is better to terminate and refer than to continue 
a possibly destructive relationship. The important point to remember is that 
termination by the therapist is viewed in DBT as a failure of therapy, not a 
failure of the patient. 
Punishment versus Punitiveness 
Treating borderline patients is extremely stressful; often, the behaviors tar­
geted for change are the very ones that increase this stress. Vindictiveness and 
hostUity toward patients are not uncommon feelings for therapists in this sit­
uation. Punishing the patients, however, is not an appropriate way to express 
these feelings. In my experience, it is extraordinarily easy for therapists to 
punish patients covertly, hiding the behavior under the guise of therapeutic 
responding. Involuntarily hospitalizing a patient (or refusing to hospitalize 
her), suggesting a referral, terminating therapy, medicating heavily, confronting 
a patient, making invalidating appeals to unconscious motivations, and writing 
pejorative case notes can aU appear "therapeutic" even when they are used 
in decidedly nontherapeutic ways. With aversive consequences in particular, 
therapists must watch their own behavior with borderline patients very care­
fully. The consultation team can be extremely useful here. 
There are a number of guidelines for evaluating the legitimacy of aver­
sive responses. First, the behavior being punished should be target-relevant. 
With the exception of observing limits (see below), DBT ignores behaviors 
that are not targeted, even if the therapist privately or professionally disap­
proves of them. Second, behaviors lower on the DBT target hierarchy are ig­
nored in favor of higher-priority behaviors. Thus, in DBT, therapists let many 
maladaptive behaviors go by the wayside. (Behaviors ignored in the early 
phases of therapy, however, may not be ignored in later phases.) Third, if ex-
tinctioh or reinforcing competing behaviors would work just as well, aversive 
consequences should be delayed. Finally, the gains should outweigh the risks, 
which I describe next. 
Side Effects of Aversive Consequences. 
Aversive consequences, even when conscientiously applied, have important 
side effects that the therapist must consider First, punishment functions only 
to suppress behavior; it does not teach new behavior Thus, punishment used 
alone does not teach the individual how to solve her problems and meet her 
needs in more adaptive ways. Once punishment is stopped—say, at the end 
of therapy or a patient's discharge from a treatment unit—the punished be­
havior is likely to come right back. Second, the effects of punishment usually 
only last while the individual meting out the punishment is nearby; thus, the 
punished behavior is Hkely to continue in secret. This can create serious ther-
--- Page 333 ---
314 BASIC TREATMENT STRATEGIES 
apy problems if the therapist is using punishment to conttol suicidal behaviors. 
Third, people usuaUy withdraw from and/or avoid people who punish them. 
Thus, the use of aversive consequences as a therapeutic procedure is likely 
to weaken the positive interpersonal bond necessary in the treatment of bor­
derline patients. With borderline patients in particular, aversive consequences 
can prompt alienation, emotional withdrawal and inability to talk, prema­
ture termination, and suicidal behaviors (including aaual suicide). Iatrogen­
ic effects often result from matching the wrong punishment to the behavior 
For example, harsh confrontation of a withdrawn or disassociating patient 
during a session is unlikely to help her talk. Commenting on the effects of 
her withdrawal—'I know this is very difficult for you, but I can't help you 
if we can't figure out a way to get you back into the session"—may help. Taken 
together, these negative side effeas suggest that aversive consequences should 
be the last contingency management procedure considered. 
Determining the Potency of Consequences 
A therapist simply cannot assume that a particular consequence will be rein­
forcing, neutral, or punishing for a patient. What works for one patient may 
not work for another The only way to determine whether a consequence is 
working is to observe closely. Although the therapist can use his or her the­
ory or assumptions as well as the patient's to suggest possible reinforcers or 
punishments, these cannot guarantee what will in faa work. There is no sub­
stitute for observation and experimentation in this situation. Potential rein­
forcers differ not only between people, but also by context within the same 
person. This pattem creates enormous difficulty and fmstration for therapists. 
Praise, warmth, advice, nurturance, cheerleading, belief in the patient, con­
tact, and avaUabUity, for example, may or may not be reinforcing, depending 
on the particular state of the patient and current events (i.e., the context). 
Thus, it is important for the therapist and patient together to learn not only 
what various consequences wiU reinforce or punish, but the conditions un­
der which they will do so. 
Praise as a Reinforcer 
Borderline and suicidal individuals are often both eager for praise and very 
afraid of it. The fear may be expressed either direaly or through indirea state­
ments (requests not to praise, questions about the validity of the therapist's 
praise, etc.). They sometimes even revert to more dysfunaional behaviors fol­
lowing praise. There may be many reasons for this dislike of praise. A patient 
may be afraid that praise means she is doing well and therapy will be ended. 
Abandonment fears surface. Or the patient may interpret praise as the ther­
apist's trying to "ga rid" of her Anger and/or panic may result. When praised, 
a borderline patient may also fear that the therapist wiU now expea more 
than she can deliver Fears of failure and of disappointing the therapist are 
--- Page 334 ---
Change Procedures: Part I. Contingency Procedures 315 
set off. At other times, praise may be experienced as a denial of the patient's 
very real difficulties and failures in other areas. The patient experiences a sense 
of invalidation. The common theme in all of these reactions is the patient's 
fear of being left on her own, having to be independent of the therapist and 
self-reliant before she is able or ready. 
A patient's fears about praise may have been reinforced in several ways. 
In the past, praise may have been associated with withdrawal of further help 
and assistance, or with punishment for subsequent failure on the same task. 
If so, praise for succeeding or doing well on a task she is not sure she can 
succeed at again will signal an upcoming absence of needed help and a threat 
of punishment. A skUls training client of mine almost never gave me an op­
portunity to praise her, always saying that she hadn't praaiced any new be­
haviors, was more miserable now than ever, and wanted to kill herself. Any 
attempt at praise was met with claims that I obviously did not understand 
her After about 6 months, I began to question whether the program was ef­
feaive for her and should continue. At that point she demonstrated how much 
she had aauaUy learned, stating that she had no intention of letting me know 
this before, because if I knew I might not let her continue with skiUs training. 
A borderline patient often sets unrealistically high standards for herself. 
As a consequence, she often believes that praise is undeserved. Anybody should 
be able to do what the therapist has praised her for. Praise is experienced 
as a further reflection of her inadequacies. This is especiaUy likely if the be­
havior praised is indeed trivial or if praise is given in a glib or insincere man­
ner Guilt and/or humiliation may result, often followed quickly by self-direaed 
anger and, at times, parasuicidal episodes. The therapist must anticipate this 
and other negative effects of praise and move to counteract them. For exam­
ple, the therapist may explore the patient's unrealistic expeaations for her­
self. Analysis of "shoulds" (see Chapter 8) as well as cognitive modification 
strategies (see Chapter 11) can be employed. 
Generally, the inability to accept appropriate praise should be viewed 
as a therapy-interfering behavior and analyzed and treated as such. The ther­
apist should discuss the consequences of an inability to accept praise, both 
in therapy and outside of therapy. The strategy is to continue praising when 
appropriate—that is, to continue giving positive feedback following progress 
or positive change. But for this to work, the therapist must be careful not 
to pair praise with negative consequences for the patient. Thus, praise should 
not be followed with withdrawal of or limitations in contact. After praising 
a patient, I often reassure her that I know she stiU has many other problems 
and difficulties that need work. The therapist should also be especiaUy vigilant 
about not raising expeaations too high for the patient foUowing praisewor­
thy behavior For example, praising a patient for going through a particular­
ly difficult experience without resorting to parasuicide, and then the next time 
she engages in parasuicide accusing her of not wanting to improve her be­
havior (since the therapist now knows she can), will reinforce the patient's 
own fears of praise. 
--- Page 335 ---
316 BASIC TREATMENT STRATEGIES 
The continued exposure to praise in an atmosphere that does not rein­
force fear, shame, or anger should in the long run change the valence of praise 
from negative to neutral. Pairing praise with other positive therapeutic be­
haviors should eventually lead to a positive valence. The reasoning behind 
this is that it is important for the patient to learn to be reinforced by praise. 
Praise is one of the most commonly used social reinforcers in everyday life. 
A person who is either punished by praise or neutral to it is at a distinct dis­
advantage. 
Purser Comments on Relationship Contingencies 
In Chapter 5 I have discussed the "attached" patient versus the "butterfly" 
patient. The attached patient is the one who has little difficulty estabHshing 
a close and intimate relationship with the therapist. With this patient, ther­
apist warmth, approval, and intimacy are likely to be strongly reinforcing. 
In contrast, a close therapeutic relationship may not be a potent reinforcer 
for the butterfly patient. Indeed, for this patient, therapeutic closeness may 
be aversive. This may be due to circumscribed factors related specifically to 
the relationship with the therapist, or it may reflect more general issues re­
lated to interpersonal closeness and intimacy. For example, the adolescent 
patient may be working to achieve automony from all adults, including an 
adult therapist. Therapist behaviors that signal too much intimacy or close­
ness, therefore, may be counterproductive. 
The key here, as in all contingency management, is to keep a close eye 
on the effects of interpersonal warmth and attachment on the patient's be­
havior I find it helpful to take set point theory from the field of weight regu­
lation and apply it to the interpersonal domain. Set point theory suggests 
that each individual has a "set point" for weight regulation, such that the 
body will defend that weight (plus or minus 10 or so pounds). When over 
the set point range, the individual stops being hungry and finds it difficult 
to eat; body metabolism speeds up to reduce the person's body weight back 
to set point. When under the set point range, the individual is famished and 
finds it difficult to think of anything other than eating; body metabolism slows 
down to keep the person from losing any further weight. By analogy, in in­
terpersonal relationships, each individual has a set point range of intimacy 
that he or she is comfortable with and will defend that range, so to speak. 
When over their set point, people wiU push others away, and attempts at greater 
intimacy will be experienced as aversive. Even small steps toward greater in­
timacy will be experienced as threatening. When under their set point, peo­
ple will reach out for intimacy; warmth and closeness from others will be 
experienced as reinforcing; coolness and distancing behaviors will be ex­
perienced as aversive; and even large steps toward greater intimacy will be 
viewed as inadequate. The frequent comments of therapists that their bor­
deriine patients can never be "filled up" reflect this phenomenon. I suspea 
that this is rarely, if ever, true. From my perspective, the attached patient and 
--- Page 336 ---
Change Procedures: Part I. Contingency Procedures 317 
the butterfly patient differ in their respective relationship set points. The at­
tached patient, once placed in a secure, bonded, and warm relationship for 
long enough, will eventually relax and stop clinging (much as the thin per­
son with a high weight set point will stop being insatiably hungry after he 
or she gains enough weight to enter the set point range). The butterfly pa­
tient, if given enough room to move, not punished for frequently flying out 
of the therapist's hand, and not punished when she returns, will in time be­
come more attached. 
Principles of Satiation 
The set point analogy provides a second important point, which applies to 
the use of praise (discussed above) as weU as to any other reinforcer: The poten­
cy of any reinforcer depends on whether the individual has already received 
the desired or needed level of the reinforcer The question to ask is this: Is 
the person already sated on what is being offered? Food is not likely to be 
a good reinforcer for a person who has just finished a large meal. Too much 
praise, freedom, or warmth, too many phone caUs, and so on will not work. 
The secret is "just enough." Unfortunately, there is no substitute (once again) 
for trial and error and close observation to determine "just enough" for any 
particular patient. The principle also suggests that if the therapist offers too 
much of a "good thing," the value of what is offered as a reinforcer is likely 
to be diminished. 
Using Natural Over Arbitrary Consequences 
Whenever possible, natural rather than arbitrary consequences should be ap­
plied. Natural consequences are those that flow from and are characteristic 
outcomes of a behavior in everyday life. The consequences are intrinsic, rather 
than extrinsic, to the situation and the behavior SmUing, moving closer, and 
nodding are natural consequences of someone's saying something we like; 
giving the proverbial M&M is an example of arbitrary reinforcement. Giv­
ing a patient what she asks for is a natural consequence of skillful assertive 
behavior Saying "good!" but not giving her what she wants is not only ar­
bitrary reinforcement, but far less potent. 
Natural consequences are used for two reasons: Patients prefer them, and 
they work better. With respect to preference, in my experience borderline in­
dividuals have a very keen eye for arbitrary consequences, and distrust and 
dislike them intensely. Many an argument between patient and therapist 
revolves around the reasonableness of consequences, especially aversive ones. 
The more arbitrary a consequence is, the more difficulty a patient wiU have 
in seeing it as a result of her behavior Instead, she is Hkely to view it as result­
ing from characteristics of the therapist or the treatment setting that have lit­
tle to do with her. She may see the therapist as autocratic, withholding, or 
simply paid to approve. The relationship of the consequence to the behavior— 
an essential part of learning—is lost. 
--- Page 337 ---
318 BASIC TREATMENT STRATEGIES 
Natural consequences also work better because they promote generali­
zation. Behavior under the control of arbitrary consequences is less likely to 
generalize to other situations; thus, regression or loss of gains can be expeaed. 
The use of interpersonal consequences and the correction-overcorreaion tech­
nique, described above, have been designed to meet this criterion. The inter­
personal reaaions of the therapist, both positive and negative, are likely to 
qualify as natural as long as the responses are genuine and are reasonably 
typical of or simUar to other people's. Observing limits (see below) and recipro­
cal communication strategies (see Chapter 12), also reflect this preference for 
natural consequences. 
At times, however, arbitrary reinforcers are the only effective ones avail­
able to the therapist. In these cases, the therapist should pair the arbitrary 
consequence with a more natural consequence. As the natural consequence 
becomes associated with the arbitrary one, the therapist can then gradually, 
over time, fade out use of the arbitrary reinforcer The idea is to try to sttength-
en the effeaiveness of natural consequences by pairing them with highly desir­
able arbitrary ones. (This point has also been made above in discussing praise.) 
To go back to the example of assertive behavior above, praising what the pa­
tient said that influenced the therapist while at the same time giving her what 
she asks for is an example of pairing an arbitrary and a natural reinforcer 
Principles of Shaping 
In shaping, gradual approximations to the target (or goal) behaviors are rein­
forced. Shaping requires the therapist to break the desired behavior down into 
small steps and to teach theses steps sequentiaUy. Shaping is essential with 
all patients, but particularly with borderline patients because of their past 
histories favoring hopelessness and passivity. Trying to extract an adaptive 
behavior from such a patient without reinforcing small steps on the way to 
the goal behavior simply does not work. It is like promising a hiker a sump­
tuous banquet if she can get to the other side of a high mountain, and then 
refusing to feed her during the 10-day journey. 
Shaping has to do with what behaviors a therapist expects from a pa­
tient and is willing to reinforce. The failure of the patient's environment to 
teach more adaptive behaviors can be laid, at least partially, to a failure to 
use principles of shaping. That is, the expectations of the environment are 
too high for the abUities of the patient; as a result, progress is often punished 
because it does not come up to expectations, rather than reinforced because 
it represents an improvement over past behavior The unrealistic standards 
of borderline patients, discussed throughout this book, are another result of 
this failure to apply shaping principles. 
It may be helpful to think of a line starting where a patient was at the 
beginning of therapy and ending where the patient is trying to get to (goal 
behavior). Whether the therapist reinforces, punishes or ignores target-relevant 
behavior has to do with (1) the patient's present location on the continuum. 
--- Page 338 ---
Change Procedures: Part I. Contingency Procedures 319 
(2) her abUity to produce behavior further along the continuum, and (3) the 
requirements of the situation. If the patient has moved along the continuum — 
that is, if a behavior represents progress—the therapist should reinforce it. 
If not, the therapist should ignore or punish it and, if necessary, teach new 
behavior During each interaction, the therapist must continually match the 
patient's behaviors with her present status (including her vulnerabilities with­
in the situation), her potential capabilities, and the nature of the situation. 
This information, in turn, is used to produce a therapeutic response. No 
wonder working with this population is so difficult. Because of the complex­
ity and extensiveness of borderline patients' problems, as well as the chang­
ing nature of their deficits depending on context, therapists usually have to 
keep a large number of continua in their heads at the same time. Keeping 
so much information organized and avaUable for use is difficult under the 
best of conditions. It is magnified with patients who put so much personal 
stress on their therapists, making flexible use of the information tenuous. 
DBT approaches this problem in two ways. First, clear hierarchical tar­
geting allows a therapist to compartmentalize information—to attend to some 
behaviors and ignore others. The therapist does not attend to all patient be­
haviors equally. Instead, the therapist checks behaviors against the target hier­
archy and then attends to only those that are relevant to the highest-priority 
current target. Thus, the task is simplified. Second, the consultation-to-the-
patient strategies, discussed in Chapter 13, are designed to limit the number 
of people the therapist is "treating." In contrast to most other treatment pro­
grams, DBT stipulates that the therapist only treats the patient. There is no 
need to organize and try to implement the treatment plans of other profes­
sionals; that is, each therapist only has to worry about his or her own responses 
to the patient. Thus, again, DBT copes by narrowing the focus of the ther­
apist to a manageable amount of complexity. 
OBSERVING-LIMITS PROCEDURES 
The observing-Iimits approach is simple in theory and difficult in practice. 
It is the application of problem-solving strategies and contingency manage­
ment procedures to patient behaviors that threaten or cross the therapist's 
personal limits. Observing limits is essential to DBT. The responsibility for 
taking care of the therapist's limits in DBT belongs to the therapist, not to 
the patient. The therapist must be aware of which patient behaviors he or 
she is able and wiUing to tolerate and which are unacceptable. This informa­
tion should be given to the patient in a timely fashion, before it is too late. 
The therapist must also specify which behaviors he or she can accept only 
temporarily and which are acceptable over the long haul, as well as which 
patient behaviors are likely to lead to therapist burnout and which are not. 
Patient behaviors that cross the therapist's limits are a special type of therapy-
interfering behaviors; thus, limit-relevant behaviors are second only to sui-
--- Page 339 ---
320 BASIC TREATMENT STRATEGIES 
cide crisis behaviors and parasuicide (or other life-threatening behaviors) as 
a target of therapy. They are therapy-threatening because they interfere with 
the therapist's ability or willingness to carry on with therapy. It is crucial for 
a therapist not to ignore such behaviors; otherwise the therapist will sooner 
or later burn out, terminate therapy, or otherwise harm the patient. In ob­
serving limits, the therapist takes care for the patient by taking care of him­
self or herself. 
Rationale for Observing Limits 
Limits and how to set them constitute a major concern in almost every dis­
cussion of borderline treatment. Such discussions are ordinarily framed in 
terms of containing or stopping the patient's maladaptive behaviors. Green, 
Goldberg, Goldstein, and Leibenluft (1988), for example, state: "Should these 
[standard psychotherapeutic techniques] fail to stem an individual's regres­
sive acting out, then more vigorous measures, in the form of appropriate limit 
setting interventions, are required" (p. ix). Maladaptive behaviors are viewed 
as a result of the patient's having no boundaries or limits to her sense of self; 
the major goal of limit setting, therefore, is reinforcement of the patient's sense 
of identity through enhancing her personal boundaries. (See Green et al., 1988, 
for a review of this literature.) 
Observing limits in DBT, by contrast, is concerned with preserving the 
personal limits of the therapist—the therapist's sense of self, as it were. The 
goal is to make sure that the contingencies operating in therapy do not pun­
ish the therapist's continued involvement. The focus is on the relationship 
between the therapist's limits and the patient's behavior When a patient pushes 
a therapist's limits, the situation is examined in terms of the fit between the 
patient's needs or desires and the therapist's abilities or wishes. That is, the 
patient is not assumed to be disordered (e.g., too needy, too fluid). Nor is 
the therapist assumed to be disordered (e.g., manifesting countertransference 
problems). Instead, the assumption is that people, legitimately or otherwise, 
often want or need from other people what others are unable or unwilling 
to give. They push other's limits. The interpersonal fit is poor 
This is not to imply that patient behavior and therapist limits should 
not be examined for disorder The ability to limit one's demands on others, 
independently of one's own needs, is itself a very important interpersonal skill; 
reciprocal relationships require the ability to observe and respea another per­
son's limits. Many borderiine patients are deficient in this abUity. Conversely, 
the ability to know and observe one's own limits in a relationship is equally 
important, and many therapists are deficient in this ability Although DBT, 
more so than many behavior therapies, emphasizes the therapist's impact on 
the patient's experiences and perceptions in therapy, it also sees the therapist 
as reciprocally influenced by the patient's behaviors. This does not mean that 
the roles of the therapist and patient are seen as symmetrical; the therapist 
is expected to generate more accurate hypotheses about factors influencing 
--- Page 340 ---
Change Procedures: Part I. Contingency Procedures 321 
the relationship and to display greater interpersonal skUl during therapeutic 
sessions. The therapist is also expected to control his or her own behavior, 
to insure that therapist actions at least cause the patient no harm. Despite 
these caveats, the therapist is seen as inevitably affected by the patient's be­
havior; depending upon the behavior, this may either interfere with or pro­
mote the therapist's motivation and ability to help the patient. 
Natural versus Arbitrary Limits 
With very few exceptions, there are no arbitrary limits in DBT. The only pa­
tient behavior that is arbitrarily Hmited in both individual therapy and skills 
training is dropping out: Therapy is suspended if the patient drops out of 
either The only arbitrary limits on therapist behavior are those set forth by 
professional ethical guidelines. Sexual interactions with patients, for exam­
ple, are not acceptable under any conditions. 
Natural limits vary among therapists, and within the same therapist over 
time, as a result of any number of factors. These include personal events in 
a therapist's life and work setting, the current patient-therapist relationship, 
the therapist's goals for the patient,-and the characteristics of a particular 
patient. Limits narrow when a therapist is sick or overworked, and broaden 
when he or she is rested and has a reasonable caseload. The very broad limits 
of one therapist on my team narrowed after he and his wife had a baby. Ther­
apists with a supportive consultation team or supervision will presumably 
have broader limits than therapists working alone or in a hostile environment. 
My willingness to put up with a patient's screaming in sessions is far greater 
in my private office than in a clinic setting where it bothers others. My will­
ingness to put up with suicide threats at the end of a session is greater if I 
don't have another patient waiting than if I do. 
Moreover, each therapist on a team, including those working with the 
same patient, may have different limits. One therapist's limits may be very 
broad, another's very narrow. For example, one therapist may carefuUy read 
every letter a patient writes, no matter how long or frequently sent; another 
may not. One therapist may be willing to call a patient when on vacation; 
another may not. My limits on suicidal risk I am willing to tolerate among 
my outpatients are broader than those of many other therapists in Seattle. 
Some therapists are not bothered when patients faU to cancel sessions before 
missing them or are late in paying fees, others are. Patients' engaging in clinging 
and dependent behaviors or sitting in the waiting room all day bothers some 
therapists and not others. The list could be endless. 
Generally, a strong therapeutic alliance leads to broader limits. People 
in general are usually willing to do more for and tolerate more from those 
they feel close to than those they feel distant from. Therapists' limits are or­
dinarily broader with patients who work hard at therapy and narrower with 
those who refuse to comply with or resist interventions. The ways in which 
limits are affected by patient behaviors, however, may vary among members 
--- Page 341 ---
322 BASIC TREATMENT STRATEGIES 
of the same treatment team. For example, some therapists' limits narrow when 
patients are attacking and broaden when they are not; other therapists take 
attacks in their stride and are not affeaed much one way or the other I am 
wUling to give a fair amount of phone time, even at inconvenient times, to 
patients who call and seem to be helped by calling. Patients who charaaeristi­
cally say that they feel as bad at the end as they did at the beginning, and 
who criticize my inability to stay on the phone longer, are not patients I am 
wUling to have long phone conversations with. Whether patients "Yes, but. .." 
me or reject all of my suggestions doesn't affect my limits much; I see it as 
a challenge. Other therapists I work with are not as bothered by ingratitude 
as I am, but refuse to talk for long with patients who keep rejeaing sug­
gestions. 
In DBT, there is no need for limits to be universal among team members 
or across patients. It is only important that each therapist understand his or 
her own limits and communicate these clearly to each patient. This variabili­
ty of limits across therapists and within the same therapist, in tum, provides 
a greater similarity between the treatment environment and everyday life. Life 
and people simply are not consistent, nor are they always available to meet 
an individual's needs. Even a person's closest intimates at times are withdrawn 
or unable to meet all expectations. The goal of DBT is to teach patients how 
to interaa produaively and happily within these natural interpersonal limits. 
Observing natural or personal limits requires far more openness and as­
sertion than does observing arbitrary limits. The DBT therapist cannot fall 
back on a set of predetermined rules. There is no book to look up how to 
respond when a patient comes late for the 35th time. DBT does not provide 
a rule book on limits because arbitrary rules and limits do not take into ac­
count the individuality of the persons in a relationship. Thus, the therapist 
must take personal responsibility for his or her own limits. This can be a very 
difficult task at times, especiaUy when a patient is suffering intensely and the 
limits add to the suffering. There are, however, several guidelines for effec­
tively observing limits with borderline patients, which are discussed below 
and summarized in Table 10.3. 
I. MONITORING LIMITS 
Therapists are required to observe their own limits with respect to what is 
acceptable patient behavior in each therapeutic relationship, and to observe 
these limits in the conduct of therapy. In particular, a therapist must careful­
ly and continually observe the relationship of a patient's behaviors to his or 
her own willingness and motivation to interact and work with the patient, 
sense of being overwhelmed, belief that he or she can be effective with the 
patient, and feelings of burnout. This process is much easier for experienced 
therapists than for new ones. As a therapist on my team once remarked, "It 
is very difficult to know your limits before they are crossed." Warning signs 
include feelings of discomfort, anger, and frustration, and a sense of "Oh,

no, not again." The idea is for the therapist to catch themselves before they 
cross their limits —that is, before they are suddenly unable or unwilling to 
interaa with certain patient's any further The consultation team can be quite 
useful here. 
2. BEING HONEST ABOUT LIMITS 
A therapist's limits are not presented as for the good of the patient, but rather 
for the good of the therapist. Although the distinaion is artificial, since the 
good of both parties is essentially linked in any therapeutic relationship, the 
emphasis is very different from presenting limits as for the patient's owm good. 
This different emphasis in tum leads to different effects. The main point is 
that although the patient can and should have the major say in what is ulti­
mately for her own good (she is not a child), she does not have the major 
say in what is good for the therapist. An analogy can be drawn to the ther­
apist's telling the patient not to smoke in the office because it is bad for her. 
--- Page 343 ---
324 BASIC TREATMENT STRATEGIES 
as opposed to telling her this because the therapist disHkes inhaling the smoke. 
In the first instance, both can argue the point; at a minimum, the patient 
can reasonably assert that her physical health is her responsibility. In the 
second instance, there is little room for argument. In the first instance, the 
therapist is showing little respect for the individual's autonomy and sense of 
what is good or bad for herself. In the second instance, the therapist is model­
ing self-care. At times, the second instance is also the only honest one; that 
is, much of the time we all (therapists included) try to control others' behavior 
by telling them it is for their benefit, when it really is for our own benefit. 
Honesty as a strategy can be extraordinarily effective. A borderline pa­
tient is often hungry for respect; honesty about the therapist's own limits is 
ultimately respecting the patient. It is treating the patient like an adult. The 
therapist may agree with the patient that the limits are not fair (when they 
are not), but should point out nonetheless that his or her going beyond these 
limits will probably hurt the patient in the end. If need be, the therapist can 
review with the patient the times she has been hurt by other therapists who 
did not take care of themselves properly. 
Dishonesty and/or confusion about whose limits are being observed is 
a special lure for psychotherapists, for several reasons. First, some theories 
of psychotherapy suggest that pushing a therapist's limits is pathological by 
definition. The therapist who told me that all calls by a patient to a therapist 
at home are acts of aggression toward the therapist (see Chapter 3) is an ex­
ample here. This or a similar theoretical perspeaive makes it is quite difficult 
to assess the interaction flexibly. A therapist may be unlikely even to examine 
the possibility that the trouble lies in his or her inability or unwillingness to 
extend limits for the welfare of the patient. Concepts such as countertrans­
ference wisely focus on the possible pathology of a therapist's own limits; 
however, they do not provide for the "difficult-fit" situation, where legitimate 
limits of the therapist lead to his or her not meeting equally legitimate needs 
of the patient. Second, being a therapist is a position of great power with 
regard to other people. It allows arrogance and dishonesty to go unchecked. 
This possibility is one of the reasons why supervision consultation plays such 
an important role in DBT. 
Third, most therapists have been taught that therapy is solely for the 
benefit of the patient; in training programs, the benefit of the therapist is rarely 
if ever mentioned. Thus, therapists can easily feel guilty or somehow unther-
apeutic if they attend to their own desires and needs. Borderline patients often 
suffer terribly, and sometimes therapists feel that they really could make it 
better if they just had broader limits. The options for a therapist here are 
these: (1) to repeatedly cross his or her own limits; (2) to decide that the pa­
tient's needs are simply pathological; or (3) to allow the patient to continue 
suffering and accept responsibUity for being unable to help. Difficulty in ac­
cepting that the therapist is the proximate cause of the patient's suffering often 
leads to one of the first two choices. Observing limits leads to the third choice. 
In my experience, it is this difficulty in accepting one's own impotence that 
--- Page 344 ---
Change Procedures: Part I. Contingency Procedures 325 
causes the most trouble for new and inexperienced therapists; arrogance is 
often the problem for more experienced therapists. 
3. TEMPORARILY EXTENDING LIMITS WHEN NEEDED 
Observing limits is not a license to be uncaring or unresponsive to important 
patient needs. Nor is it permission to be chaotic in responses to patient re­
quests and demands. It is necessary for therapists at times to push their own 
limits, extend themselves, and give what they do not want to give. This is 
particularly true with chronically suicidal and borderline patients. An analo­
gy to surgeons may be useful here. When they are on call, surgeons cannot 
refuse to go into the hospital for an emergency because they would rather 
stay at home, saying that it crosses their limits. But even surgeons can only 
be on call periodically. A surgeon who has been up for five nights in a row, 
getting 1 or 2 hours of sleep per night, may reach his or her outer limits and 
need someone else to take calls for a day or two. No one can survive for long 
without sleep. Similarly, when a therapist is about to reach his or her limits 
and the patient's life is in danger, the appropriate strategy is to involve other 
professionals in the provision of care. When limits are an issue and the pa­
tient is not in danger, problem solving and other change procedures are the 
appropriate strategies. The dialeaic here is between pushing limits when neces­
sary, on the one hand, and observing limits when necessary, on the other 
4. BEING CONSISTENTLY FIRM 
Patients often try to get therapists to extend their limits by arguing the validi­
ty of their own needs, criticizing the therapists for inadequacy, or at times 
threatening to find another therapist or commit suicide. They may engage 
repeatedly in parasuicide, or refuse to cooperate until the therapists "cooper­
ate" with them. In clinic and inpatient settings, they may go to other staff 
members and try to elicit their assistance, complain vociferously to other pa­
tients, or go directly to your supervisor As psychodynamic therapists put it, 
they may "act out." 
The important point here is that observing limits often means placing 
patient behaviors on an extinction schedule. The answer to a patient's limit-
extending efforts is simple: "I am who I am." Thus, in the end, the therapist 
has no option but to observe his or her own limits. It is tempting when a 
lot of pressure is applied to vacillate between expanding limits and attacking 
the patient, implying that her needs are excessive or inappropriate. The temp­
tation must be resisted. Giving in and appeasing the patient following be­
havior escalations will only reinforce the behavior the therapist is trying to 
stop; responding punitively means risking the side effects of aversive conse­
quences. The taaic here is to use the same "broken record" strategy patients 
are taught in interpersonal skills training: Over and over and over, the ther­
apist states his or her position calmly, clearly, and firmly. It may also help to 
--- Page 345 ---
326 BASIC TREATMENT STRATEGIES 
restate frequently that the observation of these limits wUl benefit the patient 
in the end. (The therapist will not precipitously terminate therapy or other­
wise harm the patient.) 
5. COMBINING SOOTHING, VALIDATING, AND 
PROBLEM SOLVING WITH OBSERVING LIMITS 
The importance of soothing the patient while simultaneously observing limits 
cannot be overstated. Not giving the patient what she wants, or being un­
willing to tolerate a certain behavior, does not mean that the therapist can­
not comfort the patient at all. The therapist also needs to validate the patient's 
distress and help her find other ways to cope with the problem. Observing 
limits must be surrounded on all sides with interwoven validation and problem-
solving strategies. Invalidating the patient's wishes and needs is rarely ther­
apeutic. 
Difficult Areas for Observing Limits 
with Borderline Patients 
Phone Calls 
Since DBT encourages rather than prohibits telephone contaa, therapists must 
determine at what hours they can be available and how long phone calls can 
last. Therapists who cannot accept any after-hours telephone calls should 
probably not work with borderline patients. Beyond that, individual patient 
and therapist needs as well as short-term issues must be considered in deter­
mining an appropriate telephone policy. A therapist who has never placed 
some restrictions on telephone calls (if only that the patient cannot call just 
to chat at 2 A.M.) either has never had a needy patient or is headed for bur­
nout and rejection of the patient. 
The duration and frequency of allowable calls vary for different ther­
apists and for different patients of the same therapist. Some therapists are 
willing to take calls at almost any time and do not seem bothered by many 
calls. A therapist who once worked with me did woodworking and painting 
in his basement in the evenings. Patients who called during the evening had 
almost unlimited time, as he continued to sand or paint while talking. Other 
therapists are unwilling to spend so much time on the phone and learn to 
end calls quickly or to call a patient back when convenient. Conditions for 
phone calls may also vary. For example, in our clinic I have had therapists 
who would (1) take calls only through an answering service and then call the 
patient back (the therapist needed time to get a glass of water and "get set"); 
(2) end calls immediately after a certain hour unless it was an emergency (the 
therapist in this case had to get up at dawn); (3) only return calls in the even­
ings, suggesting that the patient call the crisis clinic or emergency room for 
daytime emergencies (this therapist's daytime schedule was too packed to al-
--- Page 346 ---
Change Procedures: Part I. Contingency Procedures 327 
low her to return caUs); (4) end caUs immediately unless the patient had al­
ready tried a certain number of skills (the therapist was tired of "doing for" 
this patient and believed it was untherapeutic); (5) end calls if a patient had 
consumed alcohol in the last 6 hours (drinking interfered with the patient's 
ability to be helped); or (6) refuse to take another caU during the week if 
the patient called and then refused to engage in problem solving (the ther­
apist always felt frustrated after these calls). The important point here is that 
each therapist must set his or her own limits, which in turn must be respect­
ed both by the therapist and the supervision/consultation team. 
Suicidal Behaviors 
Some therapists have more tolerance for suicide threats, especiaUy serious ones, 
than others. Some are more willing than others to follow a well-thought-out, 
but high-risk treatment plan that puts them at risk of being sued if the pa­
tient commits suicide. Some therapists are philosophically opposed to involun­
tary confinement to prevent suicide; others are not. Every therapist has to 
examine his or her limits in these areas. In general, patients need to know 
that continuation of serious suicidal behavior, at least, is likely to strain the 
therapist's limits. In my clinic and my areas of clinical responsibility, patients 
who might engage in lethal behavior are not allowed to have lethal drugs. 
Some risks are not within my limits. I have also put patients in the hospital 
when I needed a rest from their crisis calls and suicide threats. However, when 
consequences of observing limits are extreme for the patient (e.g., involun­
tary commitment), it is essential that the therapist both give the patient proper 
warning and provide a way for the patient to avoid the aversive consequencq. 
It is also essential for the therapist to observe his or her limits. The topic 
of suicidal behavior and limits is discussed more fully in Chapter 15. 
Concluding Comments 
It is very important for therapists to be aware of the contingencies they are 
applying in psychotherapy. It is equally important to be aware of the effect 
of contingencies on behavior, whether such effects are intended or not. Many 
therapists seem to feel that it is unacceptable to influence patients' behavior 
by applying contingencies. Positive contingencies are viewed as bribes, and 
negative contingencies are viewed as coercive, manipulative, or threatening. 
Often these therapists value autonomy and believe that behaviors under the 
control of external influence are not as "real" or as permanent as behaviors 
under the control of internal influences. In other words, these therapists value 
behaviors under the control of the individual's "choosing" or "intent." Ther­
apists who hold to the idea of unconscious intent and choice, sometimes func­
tion as if they believe that all behavior is actually under the control of intent 
and choice; the intent and choice are simply conscious or unconscious. The 
--- Page 347 ---
328 BASIC TREATMENT STRATEGIES 
goal of therapy in this case might be to bring all behavior under the control 
of conscious intent and choice. Cognitive-behavioral therapists would cer­
tainly agree to this goal, at least with respect to unwanted, maladaptive be­
haviors. 
The difference between an approach based on "choice" or "intent" and 
a cognitive-behavioral approach is twofold. First, cognitive-behavioral ther­
apists would ask what controls "choosing" and "intent." If this question is 
answered by saying that what one chooses is what one wants or prefers, no 
new information has really been added. The explanation is post hoc. 
Cognitive-behavioral therapists would assert that choosing and intent are con­
troUed by outcomes, both behavioral and environmental. People make choices 
and form intents that have previously been reinforced; they avoid those that 
have been punished. 
Second, cognitive-behavioral therapists would not suggest that when be­
haviors are not under the control of conscious choice or intent, they must 
be under the control of unconscious intent. Indeed this may be a tautological 
statement. Instead, the cognitive-behavioral view is that the absence of a con­
neaion between intent or choice, and aaion is the problem to be solved. Such 
a connection must be learned. It is learned when reinforcing outcomes fol­
low aaions that fit previous intent to act or choice. From this perspective, 
intent and choice are cognitive activities (even though there may be an emo­
tional component, especiaUy with intent). Thus, the relationship between in­
tent or choice and aaion is a behavior-behavior conneaion. The conneaion 
is not assumed a priori. Indeed, with borderline patients the problem is often 
an inability to influence behavior by prior intent, choice, and commitment. 
Thus, therapists may set out to systematically reinforce such a 
behavior-behavior connection. 
An overreliance on choice as a determinant of behavior ignores the role 
of behavior capability. The notion of choice assumes freedom to follow 
through on one's choices. One cannot do what one is unable to do, no mat­
ter how much or how often one chooses to do it. Borderline patients are often 
unable to control their behavior as they and their therapists want them to. 
Although contingencies at times create capabilities where few or none existed 
before, good intentions alone are not sufficient to effect behavioral control 
and change.

Change Procedures: 
Part II. Skills Training, Exposure, 
Cognitive Modification 
SKILLS TRAINING PROCEDURES 
SkiUs training procedures are necessary when a problem solution requires skiUs 
not currently in the individual's behavioral repertoire. That is, under ideal 
circumstances (where behavior is not interfered with by fears, confliaing mo­
tives, unrealistic beliefs, etc.), the individual cannot generate or produce the 
behaviors required. The term "skiUs" in DBT is used synonymously with "abU­
ities," and includes in its broadest sense cognitive, emotional, and overt be­
havioral (or aaion) response repertoires together with their integration, which 
is necessary for effective performance. Effectiveness is gauged by both direct 
and indirect consequences of the behavior Effective performance can be de­
fined as those behaviors that lead to a maximum of positive outcomes with 
a minimum of negative outcomes. Thus, "skill" is used in the sense of "using 
skiUful means," as well as in the sense of responding to situations adaptively 
or effectively. 
The integration of skills is emphasized in DBT because often (indeed, 
usually) an individual has the component behaviors of a skill, but cannot 
put them together coherently when necessary. For example, everyone has the 
word "no" in his or her repertoire. But a person may not be able to put it 
together with other words in a skillful phrase to refuse an invitation while 
simultaneously not alienating the person giving the invitation. An interper­
sonally skUlful response requires putting together words that one already 
knows into effective sentences, together with appropriate body language, in­
tonation, eye contaa, and so on. The component skills are rarely new; the 
329 
--- Page 349 ---
330 BASIC TREATMENT STRATEGIES 
combination, however, often is. In DBT, almost any desired behavior can be 
thought of as a skill. Thus, coping effeaively with problems and avoiding 
maladaptive or ineffective responses are both considered using one's skiUs. 
The aim of DBT is to replace ineffeaive, maladaptive, or nonskilled behaviors 
with skillful responses. 
During skiUs training, and more generaUy throughout DBT, the therapist 
insists at every opportunity that the patient engage aaively in the acquisition 
and practice of the skills she needs to cope with her life. The therapist direct­
ly, forcefully, and repeatedly challenges the borderline individual's passive 
problem-solving style. The procedures described below can be applied infor­
mally by every therapist where appropriate. They are applied in a formal way 
in the structured skUls training modules (described in the companion manu­
al to this volume). 
There are three types of skills training procedures: (1) skUl acquisition 
(e.g., instructions, modeling); (2) skill strengthening (e.g., behavior rehear­
sal, feedback); and (3) skill generalization (e.g., homework assignments, dis­
cussion of similarities and differences in situations). In skill acquisition, the 
therapist is teaching new behaviors. In skUl strengthening and generalization, 
the therapist is trying both to fine-tune skilled behavior and to increase the 
probability that the person will use the skUled behaviors already in her reper­
toire in relevant situations. SkUl strengthening and generalization, in turn, 
require the application of contingency management, exposure, and/or cog­
nitive modification procedures. That is, once the therapist is sure that a par­
ticular response pattern is within the patient's current repertoire, then other 
procedures are applied to increase the patient's use of this pattem in everyday 
life. It is this emphasis on aaive, self-conscious teaching, typical of behavioral 
and cognitive therapies, that differentiates DBT from many approaches to treat­
ing borderline patients. Some skills training procedures, however, are virtual­
ly identical to those used in supportive, dynamic psychotherapy. 
The targets of skiUs training are determined by the parameters of DBT 
(e.g., mindfulness, interpersonal effectiveness, emotion regulation, distress 
tolerance, and self-management skUls), as well as by behavioral analysis in 
the individual case. Almost any behavior pattern that the individual does not 
currently have in her repertoire but that would be helpful in improving her 
life can be a target of skills training. The choice of specific procedures (e.g., 
acquisition vs. strengthening procedures) depends on the skills the patient 
already has. 
Orienting and Committing to Skills Training: 
Task Overview 
Orienting is the therapist's chief means of selling both the new behaviors as 
worth leaming and DBT procedures as likely to work. SkUls training can only 
be accomplished if the person actively collaborates with the treatment pro­
gram. Some patients both have skill deficits and are fearful about acquiring 
--- Page 350 ---
Change Procedures: Part II. 331 
new skUIs. It can be useful to point out here that leaming a new skill does 
not mean that a patient actually has to use the skill. That is, she can acquire 
a skill and then choose in each situation whether to use it or not. The pa­
tient's problem is much Hke that of persons who fear flying: They do not 
want to reduce their fears, because then they might have to fly. Sometimes 
a patient does not want to learn new skUls because she has lost hope that 
anything will really help. I find it useful to point out that the skills I am teach­
ing have helped either me or other people I know. However, a therapist can­
not prove ahead of time that particular skills will aaually help a given 
individual. 
Before teaching any new skill, the therapist should give a rationale (or 
draw it in Socratic fashion from the patient) for why the particular skill or 
set of skills might be useful. At times this may only require a comment or 
two; at other times it may require extensive discussion. (Specific rationales 
for each set of DBT target skills are given in the companion manual to this 
volume.) In individual problem solving, this wUl ordinarily take place in the 
solution analysis phase. At some point, the therapist should also explain the 
general rationale for his or her methods of teaching—that is, the rationale 
for the DBT skills training procedures. The most important point to make 
here, and to repeat as often as necessary, is that learning new skills requires 
practice, praaice, practice. Equally importantly, practice has to occur in sit­
uations where the skills are needed. If these points do not get through to the 
patient, there is not much hope that she will actually learn anything new. 
SKILL ACQUISITION PROCEDURES 
SkiU acquisition procedures are concemed with remediating skill deficits. DBT 
does not assume that all, or even most, of a borderline person's problems 
are motivational in nature. Instead, the extent of the patient's abilities in a 
particular area is assessed; skill acquisition procedures are then used if skill 
deficits exist. At times, in lieu of other means of assessment, the therapist 
employs skill acquisition procedures and then observes any consequent change 
in behavior 
A Note on Assessing Abilities 
It can be very difficult with borderline patients to know whether they are in­
capable of doing something or are capable but emotionally inhibited or con­
strained by environmental faaors. Although this is a complex assessment 
question with any patient population, it can be particularly hard with bor­
derline individuals because of their inability to analyze their own behavior 
and abUities. For example, they often confuse being afraid of doing some­
thing with not being able to do it. In addition, there are often powerful con­
tingencies mitigating against their admitting having any behavioral capabUities, 
as I have discussed in Chapter 10. Of particular concern here are a patient's 
--- Page 351 ---
332 BASIC TREATMENT STRATEGIES 
fears that if she admits to having capabilities the therapist will decide (prema­
turely) that therapy is completed. Or the patient may fear that if she is knovm 
to be able to do something in one context the therapist wiU think she can 
do it in all contexts, including those where she cannot. Thus, the therapist 
will withdraw assistance that is still needed, posing the possibility of failure 
(with all the associated losses and further problems that this would cause). 
Patients may also say that they do not know how they feel or what they think, 
or that they cannot find words, when in reality they are afraid of expressing 
their thoughts and feelings. As many patients say, they often do not want to 
be vulnerable. Finally, some patients have been taught by their families and 
therapists to view all of their problems as motivationally based. They have 
either bought this point of view entirely (they thus believe they can do any­
thing, but just do not want to), or have rebelled completely and never enter­
tain the possibility that motivational factors might be as important as 
abUity-related factors (they believe they cannot do anything, and this includes 
learning more adaptive ways of behaving). 
Some therapists respond to patients' statements that they can't do any­
thing with an equally polarized statement that they can if only they want to. 
Failing to behave skillfully, and claiming not to know how to behave differ­
ently, are viewed as resistant (or at least as determined by motives outside 
awareness). Giving advice, coaching, making suggestions, or otherwise teach­
ing new behaviors is viewed as encouraging dependency and need gratifica­
tion that gets in the way of "real" therapy. Other therapists, of course, fall 
into the trap of believing that these patients can hardly do anything. At times 
they even go so far as to believe that the patients are incapable of learning 
new skills. Acceptance, nurturance, and environmental intervention consti­
tute the armamentarium of these therapists. Not surprisingly, when these two 
orientations coexist within a patient's treatment team, conflia and "staff split­
ting" often arise. A dialectical approach would suggest looking for the syn­
thesis. (I discuss this topic further in Chapter 13.) 
To assess whether a behavioral pattern is within a patient's repertoire, 
the therapist has to figure out a way to create ideal circumstances for her to 
produce the behavior For interpersonal behaviors, an approximation to this 
is role playing in the office —or, if the patient refuses, asking her to describe 
what she would say in a particular situation. 1 am frequently amazed to find 
that individuals who appear very interpersonally skilled cannot put together 
reasonable responses in certain role-play situations, whereas individuals who 
seem passive, meek, and unskilled are quite capable of responding skillfully 
in the comfort of the office. In analyzing distress tolerance, the therapist can 
ask the person to describe what techniques she uses or thinks helpful in toler­
ating difficult or stressful situations. Emotion regulation can sometimes be 
assessed by interrupting a session and asking the patient to see whether she 
can change her emotional state. Self-management and mindfulness skills can 
be analyzed by observing the patient's behavior in sessions and questioning 
her about her day-to-day behavior 
--- Page 352 ---

If the patient produces a behavior, the therapist knows she has it in her 
repertoire. However, if she does not, the therapist cannot be sure; as in statis­
tics, there is no way to test the null hypothesis. When in doubt (which will 
usuaUy be the case), it is safer to proceed with skill acquisition procedures. 
Generally, there is no harm in doing so, and most of the procedures also af­
fect other factors related to skilled behavior For example, both instructions 
and modeling (the principal skill acquisition procedures) may work because 
they give the individual "permission" to behave and thus reduce inhibitions, 
rather than because they add to the individual's behavioral repertoire. These 
two basic procedures are described below and outlined in Table 11.1. 
1. INSTRUCTIONS 
Instruaions are verbal descriptions of the response components to be leamed. 
According to a patient's needs, they can vary from general guidelines ("When 
restruauring your thinking, be sure to check out the probabUity that the dire 
consequences will occur," "Think reinforcement") to very specific suggestions 
as to what the patient should do ("The minute an urge hits, go get an ice 
cube and hold it in your hand for 10 minutes") or think ("Keep saying over 
and over to yourself, 'I can do it' "). They can be presented didactically in

a lecture format with a blackboard as an aid. In standard DBT, written in­
struaions are given in the handouts with each skiU area (see companion man­
ual to this volume); other self-help books can be given. Instruaions can be 
suggested as hypotheses to be considered, can be presented as theses and an­
titheses to be synthesized, or can be drawn from the patient via the Socratic 
method. In all cases, the therapist must be careful not to oversimplify the 
ease of behaving effectively or of learning the skill. 
2. MODELING 
Modeling can be provided by the therapist, others in the patient's environ­
ment, audiotapes, videotapes, films, or printed material. Any procedure that 
provides the patient with examples of appropriate alternative responses is a 
form of modeling. The advantage of a therapist model is that the situation 
and materials can be tailored to fit the patient's needs. 
There are a number of ways in which the therapist can model skiUed 
behavior In-session role playing can be used to demonstrate appropriate in­
terpersonal behavior When events between the patient and therapist arise 
that are similar to situations the patient encounters in her natural environ­
ment, the therapist can model handling such situations in effective ways. The 
therapist can also use self-talk (speaking aloud) to model coping self-
statements, self-instruaions, or restruauring of problematic expeaations and 
beliefs. For example, the therapist may say, "OK, here's what I would say to 
myself: 'I'm overwhelmed. What's the first thing I do when overwhelmed? 
Break down the situation into steps and make a list. Do the first thing on 
the list.' " Telling stories, relating historical events, or providing allegorical 
examples (see Chapter 7) can often be useful in demonstrating alternative 
life strategies. Finally, therapist self-disclosure can be used to model adaptive 
behavior, especially if the therapist has encountered problems in living simi­
lar to those the patient is currently encountering. This tactic is discussed at 
length in Chapter 12. 
In addition to in-session modeling, it can be useful to have a patient ob­
serve the behavior and responses of competent people in her own environ­
ment. The behaviors that she observes can then be discussed and practiced 
for eventual use by the patient herself. Written models for how to apply some 
of therapeutic suggestions are also useful. Biographies, autobiographies and 
novels about people who have coped with similar problems also give new ideas. 
It is always important to discuss with the patient any behaviors modeled by 
the therapist or presented as models outside of therapy, to be sure that the 
patient is observing the relevant responses. 
SKILL STRENGTHENING PROCEDURES 
Once skilled behavior has been acquired, skill strengthening is used to shape, 
refine, and increase the likelihood of their use. Without reinforced practice, 
a skiU cannot be learned; this point cannot be emphasized too much, since

skiU praaice is effortful behavior and directly counteraas borderline patients' 
tendency to employ a passive behavior style. Skill strengthening procedures 
are outlined in Table 11.2. 
I. BEHAVIORAL REHEARSAL 
Behavioral rehearsal is any procedure in which the patient praaices responses 
to be learned. This can be done in interactions with the therapist, in simu­
lated situations, or in vivo. Any skilled behaviors—verbal sequences, nonver­
bal actions, patterns of thinking or cognitive problem solving, and some 
components of physiological and emotional responses —can, in principle, be 
praaiced. 
Praaice can be either overt or covert. Various forms of overt behavioral 
rehearsal are possible. For example, the therapist and patient may role-play 
problematic situations together so that the patient can practice responding 
appropriately. Biofeedback is a method of practicing control of physiological 
responses, or the therapist can ask the patient to practice relaxing during a 
session. In learning cognitive skills, the patient may be asked to verbalize ef­
fective self-statements. In the specific case of cognitive restructuring, the pa­
tient may be asked first to examine and verbalize any dysfunctional beliefs, 
rules, or expectancies elicited by the problem situation, and then to restruc­
ture these beliefs by generating more useful coping statements, rules, or the 
like. Covert response practice—that is, the patient's practicing the requisite 
response in imagination —may also be an effective form of skill strengthen­
ing. It may be more effective than overt methods for teaching more complex 
cognitive skUls, and it is also useful when the patient refuses to engage in 
overt rehearsal. A patient can be asked to practice emotion regulation; gener­
ally, however, "emotional behavior" cannot be practiced direaly. That is, a 
--- Page 355 ---
336 BASIC TREATMENT STRATEGIES 
patient cannot praaice getting angry, feeling sad, or experiencing joy. Instead, 
she has to practice specific components of emotions (changing facial expres­
sions, generating thoughts that elicit or inhibit emotions, changing muscle 
tension, etc.). 
In my experience, patients rarely like behavioral rehearsal; thus, a fair 
amount of cajoling and shaping is needed. If a patient will not role-play an 
interpersonal situation, for example, the therapist can try talking her through 
a dialogue ("Then what could you say?"), or try practicing just part of a new 
skill so that the patient is not overwhelmed. The essence of the message here, 
though, is that in order to be different the patient must practice acting differ­
ently. Some therapists do not like behavioral rehearsal either, especially when 
it requires them to role-play with patients. When therapists feel shy or uncom­
fortable about role playing, the best solution is for them to praaice it with 
other members of the consultation team. At other times, therapists resist role 
playing because they do not want to push rehearsal on their patients. Such 
therapists may not be aware of the wealth of data indicating that behavioral 
rehearsal is related to therapeutic improvement (e.g., Linehan et al., 1979). 
2. REINFORCEMENT OF NEW SKILLS 
Therapist reinforcement of patients' behavior is one of the most powerful me­
ans of shaping and strengthening skilled behavior in borderline and suicidal 
patients. Frequently, these patients have lived in environments that overuse 
punishment. They often expect negative, punishing feedback from the world 
in general and their therapists in particular, and apply self-punishing strate­
gies almost exclusively in trying to shape their own behavior Over the long 
run, skill reinforcement by a therapist can improve such a patient's self-image, 
increase her use of skilled behaviors, and enhance the patient's sense that she 
can control positive outcomes in her life. 
The techniques of providing appropriate reinforcement have been dis­
cussed extensively in Chapter 10. Here, however, it is important to point out 
that the therapist has to stay alert and notice patient behaviors that represent 
improvement, even if these make the therapist somewhat uncomfortable. For 
instance, teaching a patient interpersonal skills to use with her parents, but 
then punishing or ignoring those same skills when she uses them in a therapy 
session, is not therapeutic. Encouraging a patient to think for herself, but 
then punishing or ignoring her when she disagrees with the therapist, is not 
therapeutic. Stressing that "not fitting in" in all circumstances is not a dis­
aster and that distress can be tolerated, but then not tolerating the patient 
when she does not fit comfortably into the therapist's schedule or precon­
ceived notions of how borderline patients act, is not therapeutic. 
3. FEEDBACK AND COACHING 
Response feedback is the provision of information to patients about their per­
formance. I stress that the feedback should pertain to performance, not to 
--- Page 356 ---
Change Procedures: Part II. 337 
the motives presumably leading to the performance. One of the unfortunate 
factors in the lives of many borderline individuals is that people rarely give 
them feedback about their behavior that is uncontaminated with interpreta­
tions about their presumed motives and intent. When the presumed motives 
do not fit, the individuals often discount or are distracted from the valuable 
feedback they may be getting about their behavior A therapist's feedback 
should be behaviorally specific; that is, the therapist should tell the patient 
exactly what she is doing that seems indicative of either continuing problems 
or improvement. Telling the patient that she is manipulating, expressing a 
need to control, overreacting, clinging, or acting out is simply not helpful 
if there are no clear behavioral referents for the terms. This is, of course, es­
pecially true when the therapist has pinpointed a problem behavior correctly 
but is inferring motivations inaccurately. Many arguments between patient 
and therapist arise out of just such inaccuracy. 
The therapist must attend closely to the patient's behavior (both behavior 
within sessions and self-reported behavior between sessions) and select those 
responses on which the patient should be given feedback. At the beginning 
of therapy, when the patient may do little that appears competent, the ther­
apist is usually well advised to give feedback on a limited number of response 
components. For example, the therapist should limit feedback to only one 
or two of the responses needing improvement, even though other deficits could 
be commented upon. Feedback on more responses may lead to stimulus over­
load and/or discouragement about the rate of progress. A response shaping 
paradigm (discussed in Chapter 10) should be used with feedback, coaching, 
and reinforcement designed to encourage successive approximations to the 
goal of effective performance. 
Borderline patients often desperately want feedback about their behavior, 
but at the same time are sensitive to negative feedback. The solution here 
is to surround negative feedback with positive feedback. Treating a patient 
as too fragile to deal with negative feedback does her no favor An important 
part of feedback is giving information about the effects of the patient's be­
havior on the therapist. This is discussed more extensively in Chapter 12 in 
conneaion with reciprocal communication strategies. 
Coaching is combining feedback with instruaions. The therapist tells 
the patient how a response is discrepant from the criterion of skiUed perfor­
mance and how it might be improved. That is, coaching is teUing the patient 
what to do or how to improve. Clinical practice suggests that the "permis­
sion" to behave in certain ways that is implicit in coaching may be all that 
is needed to accomplish changes in behavior 
SKILL GENERALIZATION PROCEDURES 
DBT does not assume that skUls learned in therapy will necessarily general­
ize to situations in everyday life outside of therapy. Therefore, it is very im-

portant that the therapist aaively encourage this transfer of skills. A number 
of specific procedures for doing so are discussed below and outlined in Table 
1L3. 
I. GENERALIZATION PROGRAMMING 
At every step of skills training, the therapist should aaively program two types 
of generalization. In the first type, technically called "response generaliza­
tion," the therapist is concerned that skills leamed will be general and flex­
ible, so that in most settings the patient will have a number of behavioral 
options to choose from. In applying the procedures described above, the ther­
apist should be carefiil to model, instruct, reinforce, and prescribe a variety 
of skUled responses to each situation. For example, when generating skillftil 
solutions to problem situations, the therapist should help the patient think 
up a number of different responses rather than stopping as soon as one skill­
ful responses is produced. Similarly, a variety of different responses should 
--- Page 358 ---
Change Procedures: Part II. 339 
be modeled and reinforced for the same type of situations. In the second type, 
technically called "stimulus generalization," the therapist is concerned that 
skills leamed in one setting wiU generalize to other settings. Most of the proce­
dures listed below are designed to enhance this type of generalization. The 
basic idea is that the therapist should get the patient to try out skills in as 
many types of situations as possible. It is particularly important that the ther­
apist attempt to duplicate in the therapeutic relationship important charac­
teristics of the patient's interpersonal relationship outside of therapy. One way 
to do this, and still stay genuine in the relationship, is to highlight similarities 
between situations outside of therapy and the problems and interactions that 
occur within therapy sessions. 
2. BETWEEN-SESSION CONSULTATION 
Patients should be encouraged to seek consultation between sessions if they 
are unable to apply new skills in their natural environment. In individual out­
patient therapy, this consultation will usually be obtained through phone caUs 
to the therapist. Another technique, developed by Charles Swenson at Cor­
nell Medical Center/New York Hospital at White Plains and discussed in 
Chapter 6, is to provide a behavioral consultant with regular daily office hours 
whose task is to help patients apply their new skills to everyday life. On in­
patient and day treatment units, patients can be encouraged to seek assistance 
from staff members when they are having difficulty. 
During these interactions, the therapist and patient can discuss applica­
tion of relevant skills to the patient's real-life situations. In general, the inter­
actions should be conducted in a problem-solving manner, with the therapist 
being careful to help the patient arrive at effective solutions or ways to use 
her developing skills, rather than simply giving solutions to the patient. The 
temptation to give a solution rather than to work with the patient is most 
likely when the therapist is short on time or does not want to be bothered 
with the patient at that moment. In these cases, it is preferable for the ther­
apist to ask the patient to phone again or come back at a more convenient 
time. Phone calls and other ad hoc consultation strategies are discussed in 
more detail in Chapter 15. 
2. PROVIDING SESSION TAPES FOR REVIEW 
All psychotherapy sessions should be audiotaped for both evaluation and su­
pervision purposes. A second audiotape can be made of each session for the 
patient; the tape can then be listened to in its entirety by the patient between 
sessions. There are several reasons for the audiotape monitoring strategy. First, 
because of high emotional arousal during sessions, concentration difficulties 
accompanying depression and anxiety, or dissociative responses a patient is 
often unable to attend to much of what transpires during a therapy session. 
Thus, the patient may improve her retention of material offered during the 
--- Page 359 ---
340 BASIC TREATMENT STRATEGIES 
session by listening to the tape. Second, listening to a tape may provide the 
patient with important insights about her own behavior, about the therapist's 
reactions to her, and about the interaction between the two of them. Such 
insights often help the patient understand and improve her own interpersonal 
behavior and the interpersonal relationship between the patient and therapist. 
Third, listening to the session at home can help the patient use and integrate 
this material in the natural environment. Essentially, she is relearning ther­
apeutic insights outside of the therapy session. Finally, many patients report 
that listening to tapes can be very helpful when they are feeling overwhelmed, 
panicked, or unable to cope between sessions. Simply listening to a tape has 
an effect similar to that of having an additional session with the therapist. 
Such use of the tape is to be encouraged. 
Several problems may come up in getting a patient to review tapes of 
sessions. One problem may be that the patient cannot afford a tape recorder 
or audiotapes. If indeed this is the case (and often it is), the patient should 
be given several blank audiotapes at the beginning of therapy for her use. She 
should be loaned a tape recorder, and the problem of obtaining money to 
buy a tape recorder or finding someone from whom to borrow a tape record­
er should be the focus of a problem-solving session. If no other solution can 
be found, arrangements should be made for the patient to listen to the tapes 
at the therapist's office. At other times, the patient may forget to bring a tape 
with her to a session. If listening to tapes is an integral part of therapy, such 
forgetfulness should be analyzed and tteated as a therapy-interfering behavior 
Finally, a patient may state that she is unable to listen to sessions, usually 
because she finds it very uncomfortable to listen to herself. In these instances, 
the therapist can point out that most patients find it difficult to listen to tapes 
at the beginning, but with time listening not only becomes easier but is fre­
quently quite beneficial. However, listening to tapes should not become a pow­
er issue in the therapy session. If a patient adamantly refuses to listen to tapes, 
her wishes should be respected. The topic should be reintroduced occasion­
ally throughout treatment to see whether the patient can be persuaded to 
change her mind. 
4. IN VIVO BEHAVIORAL REHEARSAL ASSIGNMENTS 
Weekly behavioral assignments are an important part of the structured skUls 
training modules and are the principal way of insuring generalization of skiUs 
to everyday life. It is essential, therefore, that both the skills trainer and the 
individual therapist support the assignments made, ask the patient how she 
is doing with them, and help her overcome obstacles to engaging in the as­
signed practice. There is often not sufficient time in structured skills train­
ing, especially when is conduaed in groups, to give enough attention to 
individual problem. Patients are frequentiy reluctant to admit or discuss their 
difficulties with practice. "Standard" DBT combines skills training with in­
dividual psychotherapy It is essential that the individual therapist focus closely 
--- Page 360 ---
Change Procedures: Part II. 341 
on helping the patient apply the skiUs she is leaming to the problems for which 
she is seeking help. It goes without saying that the therapist must keep track 
of what the patient is learning in struaured skills training. 
Homework assignments in struaured skills training are keyed to the 
specific skills currently being taught. The individual therapist, however, may 
want to use some of the homework assignments and accompanying forms 
throughout therapy, or on an as-needed basis. In individual therapy, the use 
of homework forms can be tailored to the individual's needs. For example, 
one of these forms focuses on identifying and labeling emotions, and takes 
the patient through a series of steps to help her clarify what she is feeling. 
The individual therapist may suggest that the patient use this form whenever 
she is confused or overwhelmed by emotions. The companion manual to this 
volume contains a large number of homework assignment forms, covering 
each of the DBT behavioral skills. There is no reason, of course, why individual 
therapists cannot revise these forms to fit either their patients' or their own 
personal preferences and needs. 
Using Consultation-to-the-Patient Strategies in Developing Assign­
ments. In standard DBT, patients will often complain about one therapist 
whUe interacting with another therapist in the treatment program. Such com­
plaints are also often heard in clinic, day treatment, and inpatient settings. 
Problems with another therapist in the treatment program provide a rich op­
portunity for patient and therapist to work on a variety of skUls, which can 
then be practiced with the other therapist. 
For example (as is often the case in my program), a patient in structured 
skills training may complain to her individual therapist that the skills train­
ing therapist is being unreasonable or is making some other mistake. The 
individual therapist should respond by helping the patient analyze the situa­
tion and determine which set(s) of skills might be most apropriate or useful 
to practice with the other therapist. The patient might practice her interper­
sonal skills to get the skUls trainer to change his or her behavior Or it might 
be an opportunity for distress tolerance praaice —accepting both the skills 
training situation and the patient's own feeHngs about it just as they are. Or, 
if emotions are particularly intense or painful, it might be an opportunity 
for the patient to practice trying to modulalte or change emotional responses 
to this particular type of interpersonal problem. All the whUe, the individual 
therapist might pay particular attention to helping the patient practice her 
mindfulness skills (particularly a nonjudgmental stance) in the situation. At 
the next session, patient and therapist can review how the skiUs practice went. 
Just as often in my program, the complaints go in the other direaion: Pa­
tients complain about their individual therapists during skills training ses­
sions. The skills trainer can help such a patient figure out what new skills 
she can practice with her individual therapist. 
With suicidal patients it can be useful to help them practice new skills, 
particularly in communicating about suicidal behaviors, with inpatient and 
--- Page 361 ---
342 BASIC TREATMENT STRATEGIES 
emergency professional staff persons. For example, patients can practice in­
terpersonal skills to get into hospitals, get out of hospitals, get more (or less) 
attention from hospital staff, ease the worries of emergency personnel, pre­
vent involuntary detainment, and so on. Distress tolerance and emotion regu­
lation skiUs can be praaiced if rules are arbitary, restriaions are unreasonable, 
and demands are overwhelming. Teaching patients to use their behavioral skUls 
with other health professionals is so important in DBT that an entire set of 
treatment strategies is devoted to it—the consultation-to-the-patient strate­
gies (described in Chapter 13). 
Using Dialectical Strategies and Shaping in Devising Assignments. From 
a DBT perspective, problematic in vivo and therapeutic situations can be 
viewed as opportunities for practicing behavioral skills. Changing the frame 
in this way (from problem to opportunity) is an example of the "making 
lemonade out of lemons" dialeaical sttategy desaibed in Chapter 7. The over­
all dialectical tension here is usually between wanting the patient to practice 
new skills in difficult situations and wanting to patient to have success ex­
periences so that new skills will be reinforced and strengthened. Principles 
of shaping (see Chapter 10) are likewise crucial in devising homework as­
signments and must be advocated strongly by the therapist. Patients who want 
to practice only in very safe situations should be pushed, and patients who 
want to praaice in situations far above their abUity level should be held back. 
5. ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE 
As I have discussed previously, borderline individuals tend to have a passive 
style of personal regulation. On the continuum whose poles are internal self-
regulation and external, environmental regulation, they are near the environ­
mental pole. Many therapists seem to believe that the self-regulation pole of 
the continuum is inherently better or more mature, and spend a fair amount 
of therapy time trying to make borderiine individuals more self-regulated. Al­
though DBT does not suggest the converse—that environmental regulation 
styles are preferable - it does suggest that going with a patient's strength is 
likely to be easier and more beneficial in the long run. Thus, once behavioral 
skills are in place, the therapist should teach the patient how to maximize the 
tendency of the natural environment to reinforce skilled over unskilled be­
haviors. This may include teaching the patient how to create stmcture, how to 
make public instead of private commitments, how to find communities and 
lifestyles that support her new behaviors, and how to eHcit reinforcement from 
others for skilled rather than unskilled behaviors. This is not to say that pa­
tients should not be taught self-regulation skiUs; rather, the types of self-regu­
lation skills taught should be keyed to their strengths. Written self-monitoring 
with a prepared diary form, for example, is preferable over trying to observe 
behavior each day and make a mental note of it. Keeping alcohol out of the 
house is preferable to trying a self-talk strategy to inhibit getting out the bottle.

A final point needs to be made here. Sometimes patients' newly learned 
skills do not generalize because they themselves punish their own behavior 
out in the real world. This is usually because their behavioral expeaations 
for themselves are so high that they simply never reach the criterion for rein­
forcement. This pattern must change if generalization and progress are to oc­
cur Problems with self-reinforcement and self-punishment have been discussed 
more extensively in Chapters 8 and 10. Behavioral validation strategies, used 
to counteraa these problems, should be used here also. 
Family and Couples Sessions. One way to maximize generalization is 
to have individuals from the patient's social community come to sessions. 
Usually, these will be members of the patient's family or the patient's spouse 
or partner FamUy and couples sessions promote generalization in a number 
of ways. SkiUs learned and praaiced with the therapist can be practiced with 
important others. These sessions also allow the therapist to observe with the 
patient exaaly what the difficulties are; sometimes both parties may find that 
the skiUs taught so far simply are not sufficient, and that new skills must 
be developed. These sessions also afford an opportunity to instruct the fami­
ly, spouse, or partner in the need to reinforce skilled over unskilled behaviors. 
Often new skills do not generalize because they are punished rather than re­
warded by the natural community. Assertion skills, for example, are a typical 
problem here, especially when the current social environment does not have 
the time, energy, or desire to respond to the individual's needs. 
Principles of Fading. At the beginning of skills training, the therapist 
models, instruas, reinforces, gives feedback, and coaches the patient for us­
ing skills both within the therapy sessions and in her natural environment. 
If skillful behavior in the everyday environment is to become independent of 
the influence of the therapist, however, then the therapist must gradually fade 
out his or her use of these procedures, particularly instruaions and reinforce­
ment. The goal here is to fade skills training procedures to an intermittent 
schedule, such that the therapist is providing less frequent instruaions and 
coaching than the patient can provide for herself, and less modeling, feed­
back, and reinforcement than the patient is obtaining from her natural en­
vironment. 
EXPOSURE-BASEd PROCEDURES 
Exposure-based treatment procedures were designed originally to reduce un­
wanted, problematic fear and fear-related emotions.^ In DBT, these proce­
dures are extended and somewhat modified to treat other emotions, including 
guilt, shame, and anger Four conditions prevalent among borderline individu­
als suggest that a direct focus on painful emotions is necessary in any therapy 
for these individuals. First, anxiety, fear, panic, shame, guUt, sadness, and 
--- Page 363 ---
344 BASIC TREATMENT STRATEGIES 
anger are current major problems for many. The funaional value of many 
dysfunctional borderline behavior pattems lies in their effectiveness at reducing 
these emotions. Second, although borderline individuals often have many of 
the behavioral skills they need in a particular situation, their ability to use 
the skills they have is often inhibited by anticipatory fear, shame, or guilt or 
is interfered with by excessive anger or sorrow. Third, many borderline pa­
tients have such a fear of experiencing and expressing emotions that they are 
often unable to discuss emotional topics in therapy. In other words, they are 
emotion-phobic. Finally, because of past traumatic events (including child­
hood sexual abuse), many borderline individuals suffer from unresolved, in­
trusive emotional reactions associated with the stress. Some borderline pattems 
may be directly related to these ongoing emotional responses. In DBT, 
exposure-based procedures, broadly conceived, are an important ingredient 
in the treatment of these difficulties. 
There is little question that nonreinforced exposure to feared objects or 
situations is effeaive in treating anxiety based emotional disorders. Exposure 
to anxiety-related cues is important in the treatment of dysfunaional fears, 
panic, phobias, posttraumatic stress responses, agoraphobia, obsessive think­
ing, compulsive behaviors, and general anxiety (Barlow, 1988). Exposure-
based treatments have not traditionally been applied to emotions such as 
shame, guUt, and anger, however In DBT, modified versions of exposure-based 
procedures are used to reduce these emotions as well as fear-related emotions. 
In particular, the procedures as used in DBT include nonreinforced exposure 
to events that prompt fear, sorrow, guilt, shame, and anger, as well as simul­
taneous blocking or reversal of automatic, maladaptive emotional action and 
expressive tendencies. The emphasis is on both exposure and acting differently. 
Exposure-based procedures are used somewhat informally in DBT. That 
is, there is no formal module in which whole sessions or a series of sessions 
are devoted to utilizing these procedures in an explicit manner The excep­
tion here is the treatment of posttraumatic stress responses in the second stage 
of therapy. In the case of sexual abuse in particular, the strategy is to employ 
the DBT exposure-based procedures in a very focused fashion. Altema-
tively, any well-developed treatment module, especially one developed spe­
cifically for sexual abuse victims, can be either inserted or conducted con­
currently. 
Despite the informal nature of exposure in DBT, the process nonetheless 
runs through the whole of the therapy. Many of the strategies I have discussed 
previously can be reanalyzed in terms of their tendencies to expose the pa­
tient to emotionally conditioned stimuli and to block emotional action ten­
dencies. The key steps in exposure are as follows: (1) Stimuli that match the 
problem situation and elicit the conditioned affective response are presented; 
(2) the affeaive response is not reinforced; (3) maladaptive coping responses, 
including escape responses and other action tendencies, are blocked; (4) the 
individual's sense of control over the situation or herself is enhanced; and 
(5) exposure lasts long enough (or occurs often enough) to work.

Orienting and Commitment to Exposure: Task Overview 
The old advice "If you fall off a horse, get back on it" is an example of ex­
posure as a treatment for fear Most patients will have heard this adage or 
one similar to it. In orienting a patient to exposure, the therapist must em­
phasize the effectiveness of this advice. That is, the therapist must convince 
the patient that doing the opposite of what her emotions tell her to do will 
be helpful in the long run. Usually, she will agree in principle with the adage 
but will not see how it is relevant to her own problems. The therapist's task 
is to make it relevant. Dialeaical strategies, such as storytelling and other 
uses of metaphor, can be quite helpful here. 
Again, borderline patients are so fearful of emotions, especiaUy nega­
tive ones, that they try to avoid them by blocking their experience of the emo­
tions. That is, they avoid emotional cues and inhibit the experience of 
emotions; thus, they have no opportunity to learn that when unfettered, emo­
tions come and go. The therapist's task is to convince such a patient that emo­
tions are Hke waves of water coming in from the sea onto the beach. Left alone, 
the water comes in and goes out. The emotion-phobic patient tries to keep 
the waves from coming in by buUding a wall, but instead of keeping the water 
out, the wall actually traps the water inside the walls. Taking down the wall 
is the solution. 
In most instances of exposure, the patient's collaboration is crucial. A 
patient can block exposure by disassociating, depersonalizing, distraaing her­
self with other thoughts and images, leaving or walking out, digressing, or 
diverting the topic; in short, she can close her eyes and ears. Orienting and 
commitment strategies are therefore crucial. In particular, it is helpful to orient 
the patient to the fact that very brief exposures may create misery but not 
help it. That is, if she consistently shuts off exposure very rapidly, she may 
make herself feel worse instead of better Validating the extreme difficulty 
of exposure to painful and threatening stimuli, and combining this with the 
foot-in-the-door strategy (see Chapter 9), are very important here. 
Helping the patient understand the rationale of exposure-based treat­
ments is often the key to gaining commitment and coUaboration. Reviewing 
research results and the therapist's personal and clinical experience can also 
be quite helpful. Explaining in a clear way how emotions work and how emo­
tions change can also be helpful. As with learning theory and contingency 
management, the therapist needs to have a reasonably clear grasp of the 
research in emotions in order to orient the patient to and use exposure-based 
procedures properly. A number of books are excellent here, including those 
by Barlow (1988) and Greenberg and Safran (1987). A number of competing 
theories on emotional change have been proposed. Depending on the patient's 
degree of resistance to exposure and sophistication, they may be discussed 
during orientation. The effectiveness of exposure-based treatment has been 
attributed to processes of extinction, habituation, and biological toughening 
up (see Barlow, 1988, for a review). Information-processing theorists have 
--- Page 365 ---
346 BASIC TREATMENT STRATEGIES 
suggested that change is the result of emotional processing that leads to in­
tegration of new corrective information incompatible with existing threat-
related cognitive struaures (Foa & Kozak, 1986). The general idea is that 
leamed or conditioned anxiety reaaions can be unlearned,or unconditioned. 
Barlow (1988) and others (e.g., Izard, 1977), however, citing current emo­
tion theory and research, have suggested that the effectiveness of these proce­
dures is attributable to the faa that exposure-based procedures prevent the 
aaion tendencies associated with emotions. In all procedures targeting fear-
related problems, for example, emotion-driven escape and avoidance are reso­
lutely blocked. That is, the action tendency associated with fear (flight) is 
prevented. As Barlow puts it, in exposure procedures individuals "aa them­
selves" into new feelings. 
With the exception of blocking premature escape when treating fear, stan­
dard exposure-based procedures do not usually focus on changing emotion­
al behavior during exposure to emotion provoking situations. In DBT, this 
emphasis is added, and it is very important to get across a clear and convinc­
ing rationale for it to the patient. Many patients believe that expressing an 
emotion different from the one they are feeling is invalidating. Indeed, the 
invalidating environment puts such a premium on hiding and "masking" nega­
tive emotions that a therapist's request to work on changing emotional be­
havior is likely to be experienced as one more invalidation. The therapist can 
make a number of points in discussing this request. 
It is important to distinguish "masking emotions" from "changing emo­
tional expressiveness." Masking usually involves the tensing of facial muscles. 
Expressing an opposite emotion, such as calmness in contrast to fear or satis-
faaion in contrast to guUt or shame, requires the relaxation of these very same 
muscles. Masking and tensing are very different from relaxing; for instance, 
grinning to mask anger feels very different from smiling as an expression of 
joy. Having the patient try the different facial expressions can be very effeaive. 
The idea behind changing facial and postural expressions is that mus­
cles, especiaUy those in the face, send messages to the brain about what one 
is feeling. These messages in turn amplify and maintain the original emo­
tion. In DBT exposure-based procedures, the idea is to try to get the face 
and body to send a different message to the brain—for example, that a feared 
situation is not frightening. Masking, in contrast to relaxing, sends the mes­
sage "This is frightening and I can't show it." In a similar vein, actions also 
send messages to the brain about emotions. Changing an aaion changes the 
message. The research literature makes it reasonably clear that changing the 
message can change the duration and intensity of the emotion. Inhibiting emo­
tional expression, modulating (reducing or increasing) the intensity or dura­
tion of expressions, and simulating emotional expressions can be used to 
regulate or even aaivate genuine emotions (Duncan & Laird, 1977; Laird, 
1974; Laird, Wagener, Halal, & Szegda, 1982; Rhodewalt & Comer, 1979; 
Zuckerman, Klorman, Larrance, & Spiegel, 1981; Lanzetta, Cartwright-
Smith, & Kleck, 1976; Lanzetta & Orr, 1980). Thus, modulating emotional 
--- Page 366 ---
Change Procedures: Part II. 347 
expressions is one method of emotional regulation and control. This litera­
ture can be reviewed with the patient. 
Changing expressions and aaion tendencies should be presented as a 
taaic to change those emotions that the patient herself wants to change. Thus, 
the tactic is used to reduce unwanted, dysfunctional aversive emotions in the 
situations that elicit them. It is not used to reduce all aversive emotions; in­
deed, a major tenet of DBT is that the inability to tolerate aversive emotions, 
rather than the aversive emotions themselves, is a source of many borderline 
behavior patterns. Thus, tolerating emotions rather than changing them is 
often the goal of DBT. Nor are exposure-based procedures directed at chang­
ing emotional expressiveness per se. On the contrary, a major focus of DBT is 
on reducing the fear associated with ordinary emotional expressiveness. Specif­
ic exposure-based strategies are discussed below and outlined in Table 11.4. 
I. PROVIDING NONREINFORCED EXPOSURE 
The first requirement is for the individual to be exposed to the cues that set 
off an aversive emotion in a manner that does not recondition the very emo­
tion the therapist and patient are trying to decrease. That is, the person should 
not re-experience the same sort of conditions that produced the aversive emo­
tional reaction in the first place. To put it more elegantly, the exposure situa­
tion does not reinforce the anxiety response. As Foa and Kozak (1986) put 
it, the exposure situation must contain "corrective information." 
Criteria for Nonreinforcement 
In the case of fear-related emotions, the person should be exposed to cues 
that currently set off anxiety or fear responses in such a way that new infor­
mation is received and processed. The situation has to provide new informa­
tion about the threatening qualities of the situation. For example, a student 
who has failed five exams in a row becomes test-anxious. Taking another 
exam, followed by yet another failure, is not likely to reduce test anxiety. 
Although the situation is matched and elicits fear, there is no corrective in­
formation; indeed, the fear associated with taking exams is reinforced. If a 
person fears that once an emotion starts she will lose complete control (e.g., 
faint), and then she does, the exposure has increased fear instead of reducing 
it. An important point to keep in mind, then, is that exposure-based proce­
dures for aversive emotions, including fear, are only warranted when the emo­
tional responses are overreactions to present circumstances—in the case of 
fear, when fear is out of proportion to actual threat. 
In the case of guUt, the requirement that exposure be nonreinforced sug­
gests that exposure-based procedures should only be used when the guilt is 
unsupported. Guilt can be supported either by a person's firm beliefs or moral 
code or by the social community. By "unsupported guih" I mean that the in­
dividual in her calmer moments —using "wise mind," so to speak—does not

herself believe that the actions in question are wrong or immoral. That is, 
the guilt is not supported by her own beliefs or moral code. Nor is she con­
fronted with believable social condemnation or personal moral accusations 
during re-exposure; that is, she does not receive new information that changes 
her moral stance from acceptance to condemnation. Thus, exposure-based 
treatments to cues associated with childhood sexual abuse in the presence 
of an empathic therapist should reduce conditioned guilt. Exposure to cues 
associated with an act the individual believes firmly was wrong (e.g., steal­
ing, cheating, or lying, hurting a friend), especially if the act is unrepaired, 
may intensify guilt rather than reduce it. An individual who feels guilty about 
standing up for her rights wUl probably feel more guUty if each time she prac­
tices her assertion skills she is told that she is selfish or overcontroUing. 
Shame is a particularly vexing and difficult emotion, primarily because 
it is so pervasive among borderline individuals and because by its very nature 
shame interferes with the free flow of therapeutic discourse. The interper­
sonal event that reinforces shame is public censure or humiliation. The 
problems shame creates in conducting therapy with a borderline individual 
are that, first, it is often not expressed in a manner the therapist can under­
stand; and, second, the patient often attempts to hide her feeling of shame. 
Thus, the therapist often does not even know that a problem with shame ex­
ists. The interpersonal events that reinforce shame are ostracism, rejection, 
and loss of the respect of others. Thus, it is particularly important when a 
patient is revealing shameful material that the therapist respond with valida­
tion as opposed to censure, with acceptance rather than rejection. In particu­
lar, the therapist should be alert to the faa that disclosing the shamefiil events 
is itself shaming. Thus, care is needed in responding to and validating the 
act of disclosing. 
As in the case of guUt and shame, the efficacy of exposure in the reduc­
tion of anger is not explored in any detail in the emotion literature. Efficacy, 
however, is probably inextricably linked to the prevention of anger aaion and 
expressive tendencies and to the inducement of converse actions and think­
ing, which I discuss further below. With respea to the procedure of non­
reinforced exposure, however, it seems reasonable to suppose that attention 
should be paid to altering how much the situation either actually or percep­
tually frustrates the individual's attainment of goals. For example, a patient 
--- Page 369 ---
350 BASIC TREATMENT STRATEGIES 
may want to talk about topic A during a session, and may then respond with 
anger when the therapist wants to talk about her parasuicidal behavior dur­
ing the previous week. Consistent exposure to sessions in which talking about 
previous parasuicide is followed by discussions of topic A is likely to reduce 
the automatic response of anger to the therapist's insistence on conducting 
behavioral analyses of previous parasuicidal aas. Consistent exposure to losing 
the opportunity to discuss topic A may (all other things being equal) enhance 
anger Likewise, consistent exposure to the therapist's unavaUability during 
crises resulting in unwanted events, such as intense suffering or hospitaliza­
tion, is likely to increase the patient's anger when she is exposed again to 
the therapist's unavailabUity during a crisis. Consistent exposure to the ther­
apist's unavaUability, paired with the abUity to get other help or to make use 
independently of behavioral skills to avert suffering or hospitalization, will 
defuse the situation. 
A number of additional principles must be remembered. First, the ther­
apist must be sure that the exposure situation or event matches the problem 
situation or event. Second, the therapist should not assume that exposure is 
occurring simply because the patient is in the situation. Third, the exposure 
should be intense enough that emotions are evoked, but not so intense that 
it interferes with information processing or produces avoidance of therapy. 
Fourth, the exposure should last long enough for emotions to build, but not 
so long that the patient loses control. 
Matching the Exposure Situation to the Problem Situation 
There is no substitute for assessing both the charaaeristics of the situation 
that elicit the problem emotion and the elements of the situation that further 
reinforce the emotional response. The exposure situation has to mimic the 
problem situation. Context is all-important here. For example, a person who 
is afraid to assert her needs with intimate friends may have no fears with 
strangers, or vice versa. A person who is unbothered by criticism at home 
may be very bothered at work. Shoplifting may elicit little guilt, whereas steal­
ing from a friend may elicit considerable guilt. The therapist must be as care­
ful in assessing the events that reinforce or recondition the emotion as in 
assessing the context that elicits the emotion. For example, the test-anxious 
student is probably afraid of both exam taking per se and failing exams. Fear 
of taking exams may be reinforced by failing exams; fear of failure may be 
reinforced by consequences of failure, such as being expelled from school; 
fear of being expelled may be reinforced by losing friends and social status; 
and so on. The parameters of context that make a difference wiU vary by 
patient, emotion, and problem; effective treatment may require exposure to 
each parameter in turn. Exposure carried out in the relative safety of therapy 
interactions must be supplemented by direct exposure in the day-to-day en­
vironment of the patient. The more practice exposure the patient gets in her 
--- Page 370 ---
Change Procedures: Part II. 351 
everyday world, the better The generalization procedures discussed above for 
skills training can do double duty as exposure procedures. 
Insuring That Exposure Takes Place 
Presentation of emotion-relevant cues can be direct or indirect. In direct ex­
posure, the patient is exposed to actual situations or events that are emotion-
related. The individual enters feared situations, does things she is afraid of 
doing, and thinks and talks about topics associated with feared emotion. She 
repeatedly re-enacts the very things she feels ashamed of or guilty about. The 
message here is simple: The only way out of emotions is through them. De­
pending on the problem situation, exposure during sessions can include ver­
bal confrontation, structured discussion of avoided emotional topics, or 
instruaions to the patient to practice mindful self-awareness during the in­
teraction. For many borderline patients, simply going to a therapy session 
is an exposure condition. Practically anything in therapy that elicits uncondi­
tioned problem emotions can be the focus of direct exposure, as long as the 
therapist is careful to place new, corrective information side by side with the 
emotion-eliciting elements. Covert or indirect exposure involves having the 
patient imagine emotion-eliciting scenes. With imagined exposure, it is par­
ticularly important that the therapist guide the patient in "entering" into the 
imagery, rather than "watching" it as on a TV monitor Between sessions, 
covert exposure can be practiced by listening to therapy tapes. With particu­
larly difficult topics, the therapist might consider making up special exposure 
tapes for the patient's use in practice between sessions. 
It is very important for the therapist to make sure that the exposure that 
is supposed to be occurring is actually taking place. The therapist must be 
alert for cognitive diversion tactics, such as dissociating, depersonalizing, 
focusing on unrelated thoughts or images, daydreaming, and so on. Some­
times these avoidance strategies are so automatic that the patient is not even 
aware of their occurrence. When using covert exposure, the therapist should 
ask the patient to describe the scene in minute moment-to-moment detail, 
in the present tense. 
Graduating the Intensity of Exposure 
Should the therapist have the patient wade into the pool from the shallow 
end or throw the patient into the deep end the first time out, so to speak? 
This question has been a controversial one for years. Exposure intensities vary 
from the very low intensity and graduated exposure of systematic desensiti­
zation to the very intense exposure of implosion and flooding procedures. 
The accumulated literature suggests that the exposure has to be, at least in­
tense enough to elicit the conditioned emotion. There is no need, however, 
for exposure to extreme situations. Instead, graduated exposure to increas­
ingly emotion-arousing cues is easier on the patient and just as effective. 
--- Page 371 ---
352 BASIC TREATMENT STRATEGIES 
Controlling the Length of Exposure 
The question of exposure length has also been the subjea of much theoreti­
cal controversy in the research literature on fear The data are complex, but 
three points are important. First, the exposure should last long enough to 
elicit the aversive emotion at a relatively intense but still bearable level. Es­
caping or diverting attention before the emotion is elicited is unlikely to be 
beneficial. Second, the patient should end the exposure voluntarily instead 
of allowing automatic processes (dissociating, depersonalization, impulsive 
running away, attacking the therapist, etc.) to stop the exposure. With fear, 
in particular, the patient's leaming that she can control the amount and degree 
of exposure may itself be therapeutic and render future exposure less fright­
ening (this point is discussed further below). Third, when the problem emo­
tion is fear (including fear of emotions), shame, or guUt, some reduaion in 
the emotion should occur before the exposure is ended. Although it is not 
clear whether this is an essential ingredient, the tendency of borderline pa­
tients to believe that emotions are uncontrollable and unending suggests that 
the corrective information this tactic provides may be very important. The 
relationship of exposure length to efficacy may dictate longer-than-normal 
sessions at times. For example, with intense and complex fears (such as those 
typical of trauma victims), exposures may need to last 1 hour or more. 
Specific Change Stategies and Procedures as Exposure Techniques 
Behavior Analysis as Exposure. As I have pointed out repeatedly and 
described in Chapter 9, if a patient engages in a high-priority target behavior 
between or within therapy sessions, a structured and minutely detaUed be­
havioral analysis follows. That is, the patient is required by the therapist to 
talk publicly and in graphic detail about her own maladaptive behaviors and 
the surrounding circumstances. Borderline individuals often experience in­
tense shame, humiliation, fear of disapproval, anxiety, and sometimes panic 
when asked to describe their own maladaptive actions and reaaions. Some 
experience such intense sorrow or grief at the teUing that they fear they wUl 
not survive the experience. Almost all try to avoid or short-circuit the analy­
sis. More than one patient in our program has had to be "dragged kicking 
and screaming" through the process. 
As we have seen, the behavioral analysis of targeted borderline behaviors 
is a major problem-solving strategy. It is both assessment and an avenue for 
developing behavioral insight and interpretations (Chapter 9). It is also a 
correaion-overcorreaion procedure within contingency management (Chap­
ter 10). And it can be considered an instance of exposure as well. The in­
dividual is verbally and imaginally exposed not only to her own aversive 
behaviors and the events that surround them, but also to the circumstance 
of public disclosure. To the extent that the therapist is validating rather than 
judgmental, provides empathy rather than social censure, and understands 
--- Page 372 ---
Change Procedures: Part II. 353 
and accepts rather than humiliates, this exposure does not reinforce further 
shame. As the individual repeatedly analyzes her behavior in the presence 
of the therapist, survives the experience, and does not lose the affection of 
the therapist, the exposure does not reinforce anxiety and fear 
Contingency and Skills Training Strategies as Exposure. Much of the 
behavioral practice linked to the skills training modules has, as one effect, 
the exposure of the individual to activities and situations associated with in­
tense and aversive emotions. Patients are routinely asked to do things they 
are afraid of or feel unrealistically guilty about, to enter situations that set 
off anger or sorrow, and expose to the public eye events they are ashamed 
of. In contingency management and the observing of limits, the therapist con­
fronts the patient about her problematic behavior In both skills training and 
contingency procedures, in other words, a therapist gives a patient direa, evalu­
ative feedback about her problematic behavior and the likely consequences. 
The patient is exposed to interpersonal disapproval or criticism and public 
highlighting of her negative or problematic behaviors. Like behavioral analy­
sis, these procedures expose the patient to circumstances that elicit condi­
tioned shame and fear-related emotions. However, in contrast to behavioral 
analysis, where the emotion is a response to the act of self-disclosure, the 
emotion is a response to the acts of the therapist. Indeed, these therapist acts 
(confrontation, disapproval) may be the very ones that the patient fears in 
self-disclosure. The patient may respond automatically (and sometimes with 
breathtaking speed), with fears of abandonment, shame related to dependency, 
intense anger, or all three in rapid succession. The oscillating action tenden­
cies of escape, hiding, and attacking often confuse both the patient and the 
therapist. 
Once the therapist realizes that contingency and skills training proce­
dures contain elements of exposure, a number of further guidelines about 
the use of these procedures follow. First, the therapist should not stop using 
the procedures simply because they make the patient uncomfortable. In par­
ticular, the therapist should not provide very brief exposure and stop in the 
middle of overarousal of the patient. The tactic here should be to back off 
slightly, soothe the patient, and stop as the patient's arousal (fear, shame, 
etc.) goes down, even if only slightly. Second, exposure should be graduated 
instead of massed or intense. A little bit of confrontation or disapproval can 
sometimes go a long way with borderline patients. Third, as with any other 
form of exposure, the therapist should take care that a procedure does not 
further reinforce shame- and fear-related responses. When a procedure elicits 
anger, the therapist should maintain the exposure whUe simultaneously provid­
ing information that decreases the actual frustration of important goals or 
needs. Finally, contingency and skills training procedures should always be 
combined with validation of the patient's responses. The fact that she needs 
to change does not mean that her reactions are not understandable, nor does 
it mean that everything associated with a problem behavior is problematic.

354 BASIC TREATMENT STRATEGIES 
Unlinking behavioral feedback from inferred motives can be an especially 
beneficial tactic here. 
Mindfulness Practice as Exposure. In mindfulness practice (described 
in detail the companion skills training manual), patients are instructed to "ex­
perience" exactly what is happening in the moment, without either pushing 
any of it away or grabbing onto it. They are also instructed to "step back 
from" and observe judgmental responses to their own behaviors. Mindful­
ness practice may be particularly helpful for individuals who are afraid or 
ashamed of their own thoughts and emotions. The idea is to let thoughts, 
feelings, and sensations come and go, rise and fall away, without attempting 
to exert control (although it is important to point out that, in reality, the in­
dividual is in control and can stop the process at any point). In its entirety, 
mindfulness is an instance of exposure to naturally arising thoughts, feelings, 
and sensations. It may be particularly useful as a way to encourage exposure 
to somatic cues associated with emotions. The reconditioning lies in the fact 
that if a person does pull back, so to speak, and simply observes sensations, 
thoughts, and feelings, they will do just that—come and go. For many bor­
derline individuals, this is an entirely new experience and is important in reduc­
ing their fears of emotions. 
Withdrawal of Therapist Supportive Activities as Exposure. During the 
last phase of therapy, the therapist withdraws or fades some of the previous 
validating and supportive activities. Generally, this withdrawal will cue in­
tense anxiety and sometimes anger The patient is being exposed to situa­
tions where she is bereft of help and must help herself unaided. Therapists 
often collaborate with patients in short-circuiting this exposure; it is painful 
for both. However, with proper timing and orienting, the exposure can lead 
to reductions in anxieties about independence and aloneness. The secret, of 
course, is not to withdraw validation and support before the patient can ade­
quately fend for herself. To do so reinforces and reconditions the aversive 
emotions. 
2. BLOCKING ACTION TENDENCIES 
ASSOCIATED WITH PROBLEM EMOTIONS 
During exposure procedures, it is essential for the therapist to block the pa­
tient's emotional aaion tendencies associated with the problem emotion. In 
a way, all of DBT is an instance of this strategy; DBT focuses on changing 
emotion-related behavior before changing the emotions these behaviors con­
trol. The basic idea here is to follow the advice of Bariow (1988) and try to 
get the patient to "act her way" into feeling different. 
The most important response to block is avoidance. The fundamental 
action tendency in fear-related emotions is escape or avoidance. Borderiine 
patients (and many other patient populations as weU) consistentiy try to avoid 
--- Page 374 ---
Change Procedures: Part II. 355 
situations that create aversive emotions. During sessions, they resist behavioral 
analysis and discussions of emotion-provoking situations. Once they are per­
suaded to participate, they continually divert the discussion to more com­
fortable topics. During imaginal procedures, they start thinking about 
something else. Most patients avoid homework practice and are reluctant to 
do role playing in sessions. At times, the avoidance comes so early in the emo­
tional chain that the patient never even experiences the aversive emotion. The 
fundamental aaion tendency associated with shame is hiding. In therapy, hid­
ing is accomplished by clamming up, failing to disclose important informa­
tion or events, not bringing in diary cards or failing to fiU them out, 
withdrawing emotionally and verbally, or not coming to sessions or terminat­
ing prematurely. Important aaion tendencies associated with guilt are attempts 
at repair or self-punishment. Excessive confessions and apologies, gifts, long 
letters begging forgiveness, and the doing of favors for the injured person, 
as well as pejorative and overly critical self-judgments and parasuicidal or 
suicidal acts, are typical responses here. 
The therapist's task is to block the avoidance of fear, the hiding of shame, 
and the repairing of guilt. The aim is to expose the person to the emotional 
situation without letting the person change the situation by escaping, hid­
ing, or repairing. The best way to do this, of course, is by enlisting the pa­
tient's cooperation. This can often be accomplished by proper orientation to 
the principles of exposure; sometimes, the patient will need to be reoriented 
many times in one session. At other times, escape responses must be blocked 
unilaterally by verbaUy pulling the patient's attention back to the cues, over 
and over The secret is for the therapist to be persistent and soothing, and 
to avoid becoming demoralized himself or herself. 
The case of anger deserves special comment Escaping from emotion-
evoking situations actually goes against the aaion tendency of anger, in con­
trast to fear, shame and guilt. That is, anger naturally leads to the "fight" 
response, including approaching and attacking, fixing the situation or over­
coming it, and so on. The opposite of this is withdrawing from the situation 
for some time (and thinking about something else) or changing the topic. 
When anger is the conditioned emotion the therapist and patient are trying 
to reduce, the responses to inhibit fall into a class that, as a group, can be 
considered hostile approach or attack responses. First, of course, the ther­
apist wants to block aaual aggression, including the self-destmaive behaviors 
that often accompany self-directed anger In addition, the therapist wants to 
block or inhibit the individual's tendency to respond with overt or covert ver­
bal aggression (e.g., hostile dialogues and diattibes, yelling, aggressive threats, 
and sarcastic remarks). Verbal aggression, whether overt or covert, usually 
includes judgmental, one-sided, escalating verbal or mental reviews of the 
actual frustrating events and their deleterious consequences for attainment 
of the patient's goals. Sometimes, covert aggression takes the form of imagi­
nary verbal attacks on the object of the anger The person can be encouraged 
to replace these hostUe responses with nonjudgmental, decatastrophizing 
--- Page 375 ---
356 BASIC TREATMENT STRATEGIES 
responses. Replacing them with thinking or talking about unrelated topics 
(distraction), however, may be just as effective. One of the mindfulness prac­
tice exercises, having to do with empathizing with one's enemies, also has 
the effect of changing one's natural anger response. The evidence is reasona­
bly strong that catharsis increases rather than decreases anger 
The problem for many borderline patients is not the overexperience and 
expression of anger, but rather the underexpression of it; that is, they are anger-
phobic. In these cases, the goal is to disinhibit the experience and expression 
of anger Paradoxically, learning to inhibit anger once it is aroused may be 
very important to learning to disinhibit the initial experience and expression 
of anger Many patients are afraid that if they do get angry, they wUl lose 
control and possibly reaa violently. They also fear that if they engage in hostUe 
behavior, overtly or covertly, they will be rejeaed. Many have indeed had these 
experiences in their past. With such a patient, the therapist must combine 
exposure to anger arousal and angry behavior with training in expressive con­
trol. The reduction of anger phobia will require a balance between accepting 
anger arousal and expression (so that shame and rejection anxieties about 
anger are not reinforced further) and helping the patient inhibit overexpres­
sion (so that fear of losing control is not reinforced further). 
3. BLOCKING EXPRESSIVE TENDENCIES 
ASSOCIATED WITH PROBLEM EMOTIONS 
As I have noted earlier, changing emotionally expressive behavior can be an 
effeaive means of changing the emotion one is experiencing. Thus, it is helpful 
to instruct a patient to try her best to physically express an emotion different 
from that elicited by the exposure cues —for example, to focus on relaxing 
her facial muscles, and then half smile. Patients often resist this procedure. 
They may be afraid that if they relax their faces they will cry; most border­
line patients are very afraid and/or ashamed of crying. The therapist may 
have to take a gradual approach. 
Working on postural expressions of emotion can also be effective. Posi­
tioning of the head, shoulders, arms, torso, and legs is important in express­
ing emotion. Often the therapist will need to give the patient very precise 
coaching on exactly what changes she needs to make. The patient may be 
advised to praaice in front of a mirror Problems with body image, especial­
ly discomfort with body size, have been a special problem with borderiine 
patients I have worked with; thus the therapist must proceed here with great 
care and sensitivity. As noted earlier, it is also important to point out the 
difference between masking and actually relaxing and changing facial and 
postural expressions. A lot of orienting is usuaUy necessary here. 
It is important to know when to instruct a patient to change her emo­
tionally expressive behavior and when not to. The rule is reasonably simple. 
If an emotion secondary to a primary emotion has been targeted for reduc­
tion (e.g., fear of fear, or shame about anger), the therapist wants to expose 
--- Page 376 ---
Change Procedures: Part II. 357 
the patient to the primary emotion cues (fear and anger, respectively). The 
aim in this case is not to change expressions of the primary emotion, but 
instead to expose the patient to the primary emotional cues (including the 
somatic cues) associated with emotional expression. Changing primary emo­
tional expressiveness in these cases is avoiding the exposure. Blocking and 
changing expressiveness should instead be associated with the secondary emo­
tion. For fear of fear, avoidance of fear cues should be blocked; for shame 
elicited by anger, hiding the anger or apologizing for it should be blocked. 
In contrast, if a primary emotion (e.g., dysfunctional primary fear or anger), 
has been targeted for reduction, the therapist should suggest changing emo­
tional expressiveness. 
4. ENHANCING CONTROL OVER AVERSIVE EVENTS 
The fact that the therapist blocks avoidance does not mean that the patient 
can never stop the exposure trial. Indeed, gaining a sense of control over aver­
sive events appears to be important in regaining emotional control. Thus, whUe 
avoidance is blocked, the individual must also be taught how to control the 
event. At times leaving the situation and stopping exposure wiU actually be 
therapeutic. As noted above, the general idea is that the patient should end 
the exposure voluntarily—that is, control the ending—rather than end it 
through automatic or impulsive responses not under the patient's control. The 
stmaure of DBT as a whole is designed to enhance the individual's control 
over both her environment and herself. This enhanced control, together with 
exposure to emotion-relevant conditions, wUl presumably work together to 
enhance emotion regulation and decrease debilitating emotions. 
Since so many of the ordinary therapy interaaions in DBT can be con­
strued as exposure trials, it is important to be aware that this principle dic­
tates giving the patient some control over how session time is used. That is, 
she must be aUowed to titrate or stop exposure when the emotions elicited 
are unendurable. Accordingly, the therapist and patient need to coUaborate 
on positive and adaptive as opposed to negative and dysfunaional ways to 
end exposure. Throwing a tantrum or threatening suicide when the therapist 
confronts the patient or insists on behavioral analysis of parasuicide, for ex­
ample, is not the type of controlling behavior to encourage. Negotiating on 
intensity or amount of confrontation during sessions (especially when the pa­
tient is more vulnerable than usual), setting agendas that include discussion 
of other topics along with the behavior analysis, and other similar tactics are 
behaviors to encourage. With respect to behavioral analysis in particular, I 
often negotiate both the amount of time allocated to it and the placement 
of the analysis within the session (beginning, middle, or end). In summary, 
when therapists' behaviors are the exposure conditions, patients must be given 
some control over what therapists do and how they do it. Therapists must 
be vulnerable to influence. 
--- Page 377 ---
358 BASIC TREATMENT STRATEGIES 
Structured Exposure Procedures 
Although many DBT strategies enhance therapeutic exposure, the treatment 
of trauma following sexual abuse, in particular may need a more formal im­
plementation of exposure procedures. Other traumatic events, such as death 
of a close family member or physical catastrophe, may also need structured 
attention. These targets are the focus of the second phase of DBT, in which 
the therapist combines the substance of DBT with a more organized approach 
to exposure. In this phase, almost every session should be devoted to im­
plementation of exposure, usually by imaginal recreation of trauma cues as­
sociated with the abuse. To keep the patient oriented and attending, the 
therapist ordinarily asks her to describe the traumatic event detail by detail 
(including visual, kinesthetic, auditory, olfactory, and somatic cues, as well 
as what she was thinking and doing at each point). The exposure sessions 
may be audiotaped. Patients should also be instructed to practice exposure 
between sessions. Even when conducted in well-controlled doses, this treat­
ment procedure creates such enormous and sometimes unprediaable stress 
that it is delayed until the first-phase targets are well under control. In some 
circumstances, hospitalizing a patient for the initial exposure sessions can be 
quite useful. Formal exposure-based procedures have been developed by Foa 
(Foa & Kozak, 1986; Foa, Steketee, & Grayson, 1985) and Horowitz (1986), 
and can be adapted for second-phase treatment. 
COGNITIVE MODIFICATION PROCEDURES 
The relationship among cognitive processing, emotions, and actions is com­
plex and multi-directional. Clinical lore is rich in evidence that borderline 
individuals cognitively distort events, usuaUy by engaging in selective atten­
tion, magnifying and exaggerating events, forming absolute conclujsions, and 
viewing the world in a dichotomous, black-and-white fashion. Suicidal and 
borderline persons also tend to cognitive rigidity, which exacerbates any other 
cognitive problems they may have. Cognitive theories of emotions and emo­
tional disorders (e.g., Arnold, 1960,1970; Beck et al., 1979; Beck et al., 1990; 
Lazarus, 1966; Mandler, 1975; Schachter & Singer, 1962; Lang, 1984) sug­
gest that an individual's cognitive appraisals of events are primary determinants 
of emotional responses. Young (Young, 1987; Young & Swift, 1988) has sug­
gested that eariy maladaptive schemas underpin personality disorders; both 
the initial perception of a stimulus and cognitive elaborations of that percep­
tion are viewed as important. A large body of research and theory suggests 
that cognitive expectations and rules, or implicit and explicit beliefs about 
contingencies, are equally important determinants of action (see Hayes et al., 
1989, for a review of this literature). Cognitive therapies, based on cognitive 
theories of emotion, aim at changing the individual's typical appraisals, rules, 
and cognitive style as a first step in remediating emotional and behavioral 
difficulties. 
DBT differs from cognitive and many cognitive-behavioral therapies in 
--- Page 378 ---
Change Procedures: Part II. 359 
the place that cognitive modification holds. As I have noted repeatedly, the 
first task in DBT is to find and reinforce the borderline individual's valid and 
functional beliefs, expectations, rules, and interpretations. That is, the aim 
is to validate aspects of the individual's characteristic cognitive content and 
cognitive style. However, once this is done, the therapist is often left with 
a patient who, while arriving at valid conclusions in some cases, is also simul­
taneously selecting, remembering, and processing information dysfunction-
ally in many other instances. This creates new problems instead of providing 
solutions to current problems. 
For the sake of simplicity, I use the term "cognitive content" to refer to 
assumptions, beliefs, expeaancies, rules, automatic thoughts, self-talk, and 
schemas. That is, content refers to both what the individual thinks and what 
the individual remembers. "Thinking," as used here, refers to verbal or proposi­
tional cognitive processing and can occurs at both the conscious and non-
conscious levels (see Williams, in press, for a review of this point). "Cognitive 
style," as I use the term, refers to charaaeristic modes of information processing 
such as cognitive rigidity and flexibility, divergent and convergent thinking 
styles, dichotomous thinking, concenttation, absttacting styles, and attentional 
deficits. The distinaions are not as clear-cut as I am making them seem, but 
are helpful for discussing the focus of cognitive procedures. Cognitive modifi­
cation procedures in DBT help the patient assess and change cognitive con­
tent and modify cognitive styles. Like exposure, however, cognitive 
modification is more informal than formal. That is, DBT does not include 
a self-contained module consisting primarily of structured aaivities aimed 
at cognitive change. In contrast to cognitive therapies of personality disord­
ers, the principal goal of treatment is not to identify and change pervasive 
schemas that are believed to underpin borderline patterns. Nonetheless, cog­
nitive processes are not ignored in DBT. An important assessment task is to 
ascertain the role of cognitive content as well as cognitive style in the elicita­
tion and maintenance of targeted behaviors, including emotions. Cognitive 
modification procedures are interwoven throughout DBT. 
A very important point to remember with borderline patients is that cog­
nitive procedures should always be blended with more validation than modifi­
cation. Most borderline individuals have spent their entire Hves listening to 
others accuse them of distorting and misperceiving. All too often, such criti­
cisms have been a way to discount the patient's legitimate claims. Saying "It 
is aU in your head" is a simple-minded approach to cognitive therapy, but 
one that most patients have encountered. Thus, when a therapist provides 
feedback that a patient could indeed profit from examining the utility of her 
perceptions, conclusions about events, and remembering of events, she is Hkely 
to interpret this in a typically aU-or-none way as meaning, once again, that 
her problems are "aU in her head." A particular problem that arises is difficulty 
with the idea that she can be "wrong" in one conclusion or belief without 
therefore being "wrong" in everything she has ever believed or thought. The 
problem is an understandable one. If she is distorting now, without knowing 
--- Page 379 ---
360 BASIC TREATMENT STRATEGIES 
it, then how can she ever trust her perceptions, beliefs, and remembering? 
That is, what guidelines can she use to tell her when to trust herself and when 
not to? Helping the patient to develop these guidelines is an important part 
of cognitive modification in DBT. 
There are two main types of cognitive modification procedures: cogni­
tive restruauring and contingency clarification. Cognitive restruauring aims 
at changing the general or habitual content or form of the patient's thinking, 
as well as the patient's cognitive style. Contingency clarification is a special 
case of the more general cognitive restructuring. The focus is on modifying 
dysfunctional rules or "if-then" expectancies operating in specific instances. 
The relationship of contingency clarification to cognitive restmcturing is simi­
lar to the relationship of behavioral analysis to insight (see Chapter 9). In 
both contingency clarification and behavioral analysis, the focus is on the 
specific case or event; the focus is on the here and now, concrete situations, 
and contingent relationships. In both cognitive restructuring and insight sttate­
gies, the focus is on patterns of events, thoughts, or personal rules over many 
events, instances, and times; the emphasis is on the general and habitual. 
Contingency clarification is discussed here as a special procedure in order 
to focus the therapist's attention on its importance. In my experience, bor­
derline individuals often have difficulty leaming appropriate behavioral rules. 
By "rule," I mean a verbal proposition, either explicit or implicit, of contin­
gent relationships between events. Behavioral rules concern contingent rela­
tionships between behaviors and outcomes. Borderline patients, especially 
those in their teens and 20s, sometimes appear remarkably naive for their 
age. For example, although they report feeling hopelessness, watching them 
in aaion suggests that they frequently trust inappropriately, expecting others 
to respond to them positively and altruistically when such outcomes are un­
realistic. Borderline patients frequently respond well to very high levels of 
threat. In contrast, they may not respond to everyday communication of con­
tingencies, especially when these communications are subtle or indirea. Some­
times only extreme threats work to modify their behavior It is as if one has 
to threaten them to get their attention or to get a rule through to them. (To 
put this more positively, they sometimes do very well when, and if, they hit 
bottom.) Difficulties in learning contingencies may result from many factors, 
including the influence of mood on learning and attention; attentional 
problems per se; or more general difficulties in selecting, abstracting, and 
remembering relevant information. Contingency clarification is aimed at 
redressing these problems. 
Orienting to Cognitive Modification Procedures 
From a DBT perspective, dysfunaional cognitive content and style are both 
causes of emotional and behavioral dysfunctions and results of them. It is 
the emphasis on the latter that distinguishes DBT from many other cog­
nitive-behavioral treatments, and constitutes an important part of the orient-
--- Page 380 ---
Change Procedures: Part II. 361 
ing given to patients. That is, the patients are told that many of their misap-
praisals and information-processing errors are normal results both of mood 
and of extreme emotional arousal. Failure to learn and remember appropri­
ate rules may result from the interference of mood with learning and remem­
bering. Distortions (or failures to distort normally) are viewed as results of 
their problems, not as fundamental causes. Once cognitive distortions and 
faulty information processing begin, however, they exacerbate rather than 
ameliorate problems. Failure to learn and remember, although understanda­
ble, must still be remediated. 
In my experience of supervising and consulting with therapists, the idea 
that borderline patients may not always be distorting, exaggerating, magnify­
ing, or simply "getting it wrong" seems extremely difficult for most therapists 
to put into practice. Because a patient so often uses information differently 
than her therapist does, observes parts of situations that the therapist ignores, 
and comes to conclusions different from those of the therapist, it is very 
difficult for the therapist to avoid dichotomous thinking himself or herself. 
Someone has got to be wrong; too often, a therapist assumes that it must 
be the patient. Even when the therapist is willing to explore the possibility 
that he or she is "wrong," there may be little to gain. The idea that both par­
ties may be "right" is what is needed. It can be very helpful if both the ther­
apist and the patient are acquainted with the literature on mood, behavior, 
and cognitive processing. The material in Chapter 2 regarding the influence 
of mood and emotion on cognition and attention control (see the "Emotion­
al Vulnerability" section) is generally shared with the patient in small doses 
over the course of therapy as needed. It is crucial that the therapist under­
stand this material and present it in language that the patient can compre­
hend and accept. 
CONTINGENCY CLARIFICATION PROCEDURES 
Contingency clarification is designed to help the individual observe and ex­
tract contingencies operating in her life. As noted above, borderhne persons 
seem at times to have difficulty attending to relevant contingencies, and thus 
fail to behave in ways likely to lead to positive outcomes. At other times, they 
attend but faU to extract or remember important rules. There are two types 
of contingency clarification interventions. First, the therapist highlights natural 
rules operating in the patient's life; that is, the therapist helps the patient at­
tend to and extraa unfolding "if-then" relationships. In this sense contin­
gency clarification is a part of behavioral analysis, insight, and reciprocal 
communication strategies. Second, the therapist tells the patient rules that 
wUl be operating in new situations the patient is entering, and highlights ap­
propriate expectations. Contingency clarification in this sense is used mainly 
with respect to contingencies operating in therapy. The procedures are dis­
cussed below and summarized in Table 11.5.

I. HIGHLIGHTING CURRENT CONTINGENCIES 
The first goal is to help the patient observe, abstract, and remember the con­
tingencies operating in her everyday life. Knowing the rules and accurately 
prediaing outcomes increase the probabilities of adaptive behavior In par­
ticular, it is important that the patient understand the outcomes of her own 
behavior and the effects it has on others. Patients often attend to the wrong 
details of a situation, or, conversely, may be so sensitive to details that they 
cannot abstraa the important "if-then" relationships. Clarifying the outcomes 
of maladaptive behaviors is particularly important in obtaining a commit­
ment to change: If outcomes are not negative or painful, why change? Here 
attention must be paid to both immediate and long-term outcomes, and to 
effeas on both the patient and others. 
Clarifying the effects of situations, especially other people's behavior, 
on the patient's own responses —feelings, thinking, and aaion urges—is also 
important. Borderiine individuals sometimes have a remarkable abUity to keep 
forgetting that certain situations or people repeatedly have detrimental effects 
on them. Contrary to the evidence at hand, they keep expecting either the 
situation or their own responses to be different. Finally, the therapist also 
helps the patient identify general rules operating in the environment, espe­
cially social rules. As noted earlier, borderline individuals frequently have naive 
conceptions of how others will respond to various events. Although they are 
quite accurate at predicting people like themselves, they have a hard time 
predicting responses they have never experienced. That is, their empathy is 
strong with people who are experiencing circumstances simUar to their own, 
but weak with people who are dissimilar 
Contingency Clarification in Behavioral Analysis and Insight Strategies. 
The conduct of a moment-to moment chain analysis of behavior offers an 
--- Page 382 ---
Change Procedures: Part II. 363 
opportunity for the therapist to highlight contingent relationships. In examin­
ing the chain of events leading up to dysfunctional behaviors, the therapist 
helps the patient extract rules about what leads to what. In examining the 
funaional utUity of targeted behaviors, the therapist helps the patient extraa 
rules about the outcomes of her own behavior The therapist asks, and en­
courages the patient to ask herself, questions such as these: "What happened 
then?", "What was the effect of that on you?", "What was the effect of what 
you did?", and "How did others react?" The idea is to direct the patient's at­
tention to the relationship between her behavior and others' responses. In in­
sight strategies, the therapist helps the patient summarize information over 
a number of instances of behavior The therapist should highlight rules (i.e., 
consistent "if-then" patterns) that have emerged over time. The idea is to ar­
ticulate the mles in somewhat brief, propositional form and then to encourage 
the patient periodically to repeat them back to the therapist. 
Contingency Clarification in Reciprocal Communication Strategies. I dis­
cuss reciprocal communication in the next chapter However, an important 
part of these strategies is for the therapist frequently to give the patient infor­
mation about the effect of the patient's behavior on the therapist. A state­
ment such as "When you do X, I feel Y" is, strictiy speaking, a statement 
of a contingent relationship between the patient's behavior and the therapist's 
behavior The therapist should keep up a rather continuous verbal patter of 
the sort "When you do X, Y happens." The value of these statements in help­
ing the patient learn the effects of her own behavior on another is one of 
the primary reasons for including reciprocal communication strategies in DBT. 
2. COMMUNICATING FUTURE CONTINGENCIES IN THERAPY 
Among the most important contingencies for a borderline patient are those 
having to do with therapy. Contingency clarification here has two aspects: 
(1) what the therapist will do, given certain behaviors on the patient's part; 
(2) what the patient can reasonably expea from the therapist and from ther­
apy. DBT emphasizes therapist clarity and direaness, at least in the begin­
ning of therapy. In the final phase, such directness should be faded out to 
encourage the patient's abilities to read subtle and indirect relationship com­
munications. 
Orienting to DBT as a whole, and to treatment procedures as they are 
implemented, has been discussed extensively in this chapter and the previous 
two. Orienting is an instance of teaching the patient rules about therapy. The 
patient is told what behaviors on her part will lead to positive and negative 
outcomes, which expeaations of hers are likely to be met and which not, 
and what the consequences of some of her behaviors are likely to be. Orient­
ing not only occurs at the start of therapy (see Chapter 14 for specific rules 
to impart) and of each new procedure, but should form an ongoing back­
drop to therapy. That is, the therapist should be continually teaching, assess-
--- Page 383 ---
364 BASIC TREATMENT STRATEGIES 
ing the patient's comprehension and memory, and coaching. It is this con­
tinuing clarification of contingencies, in many different contexts and mood 
states, that is essential to DBT. Especially during the initial stages of therapy, 
the therapist simply should not expect the patient to extract and remember 
all of the rules. Nor should failure to learn or remember contingencies al­
ways be interpreted in motivational terms. 
COGNITIVE RESTRUCTURING PROCEDURES 
Cognitive restructuring is a way of helping the patient change both the style 
and content of her thinking. Four aspeas of thinking are of interest: (1) non­
dialeaical thinking (e.g., dichotomous, rigid, extreme thinking styles); (2) 
faulty general nUes governing behavior (beliefs, underlying assumptions, ideas, 
expeaations); (3) dysfunaional descriptions (e.g., automatic thoughts, evalu­
ative name calling, exaggerated labels); and (4) dysfunctional allocations of 
attention. The procedure first requires the observation and analysis of these 
aspeas of the patient's thinking, followed by an attempt to generate new and 
more funaional styles, rules, descriptions, and attentional strategies to replace 
those that cause the patient trouble. Change can be initiated by verbally 
challenging current thinking and attentional biases; by offering alternative 
theories, explanations, and descriptions; and by examining available evidence 
(and obtaining new evidence where needed) pertaining to the accuracy of the 
patient's rules and labels. Changes are strengthened by relentless practice. Cog­
nitive restruauring procedures are discussed below and summarized in Table 
11.6. 
I. TEACHING COGNITIVE SELF-OBSERVATION 
If the patient is to succeed in monitoring and changing her cognitive pattems 
over time and across situations, it is crucial that she learn to observe her own 
thought patterns and style. For a variety of reasons, suicidal and borderline 
individuals rarely have this ability. Instead, their involvement in the process 
of appraising or thinking about an event or situation is so intense that they 
are unable to step outside of themselves, so to speak, and reflea on the aaual 
thinking and appraisal processes independently of the activities themselves. 
The primary therapeutic strategy used is that of cognitive self-observation 
practice (i.e., behavioral rehearsal where the behavior rehearsed is self-
observation of cognitive processes), with the therapist giving the patient in-
stmctions, feedback, coaching, and reinforcement. Practice methods can range 
from instructing the patient to try to stand imaginally outside herself and 
observe what is going on in a session, to giving her an assignment to monitor 
and write down her thought pattems during specific situations or under speci­
fied conditions. If a writing assignment is given, it is useful for the therapist 
to review in detail with the patient various methods of carrying out the as­
signment. Mindfiilness praaice (see the companion manual) and other medi-

Anti-DBT tactics 
T tells P her problems are "all in her head." 
T oversimplifies P's problems, implying that aU wUl be well if P can just change 
her "attitude," her thoughts, or her way of viewing things. 
T gets into a power struggle with P about how to think. 
tation disciplines can also support the learning of self-observation. 
The key problem in teaching cognitive self-observation is that it is usually 
most needed when the patient is experiencing extreme negative affect. And 
it is just at those times that the patient is least likely to tolerate the emotion 
long enough to observe her thought and appraisal patterns accurately. Fears 
of what she will find if she ever looks "inside" closely can also lead to avoidance 
of the task. Thus, the therapist has to monitor the procedure carefully in order 
to keep requirements at a level that the patient can master The principles 
of shaping must be remembered here. 
2. IDENTIFYING AND CONFRONTING 
MALADAPTIVE COGNITIVE CONTENT AND STYLE 
As noted repeatedly, DBT suggests that cognitive content and cognitive style 
are no less important than environmental or other behavioral factors in the 
development and maintenance of dysfunctional borderline patterns. Thus, 
when conducting behavioral analysis, the therapist should search for cogni-
--- Page 385 ---
366 BASIC TREATMENT STRATEGIES 
tive precursors and effects of maladaptive actions and reactions just as care­
fully as for other precursors and outcomes. 
Many of the DBT strategies require the therapist (implicitly, if not ex­
plicitiy) to identify, challenge, and confront problematic beliefs, assumptions, 
theories, judgmental evaluations, and tendencies to think rigidly and in ab­
solute and extreme terms (i.e, nondialeaical thinking). Dialeaical strategies, 
problem-solving strategies, irreverent communication strategies, and all of the 
skiUs training modules focus in whole or in part on how the patient organizes 
and uses information and what the patient thinks about herself, about thera­
py, and about the relationship between herself and her world. The therapist's 
ability to ferret out the cognitive problem in a specific instance, to present 
it to the patient in a persuasive manner, and to suggest a viable alternative 
are very important. A number of the strategies discussed in previous chapters 
(e.g., the devil's advocate dialectical strategy, the foot-in-the-door commit­
ment strategy) are designed with this in mind. A dialeaical style is very im­
portant, however, for the therapist must help the patient expand her cognitive 
options rather than prove her "wrong." Therefore, validation of existing view­
points is important while suggesting that others are possible. 
3. GENERATING ALTERNATIVE, ADAPTIVE 
COGNITIVE CONTENT AND STYLE 
Once maladaptive patterns of thought, dysfunaional rules and expeaations, 
and problematic cognitive styles have been identified, the next step is to find 
more adaptive ways of thinking that the patient can adopt. The most impor­
tant DBT rule here is that the therapist should teach and reinforce dialectical 
thinking styles over purely "rational" or purely emotional-based thinking. Dia­
leaical thinking (as well as dialectical dilemmas for borderline patients) has 
been discussed at length in Chapters 2, 3, 5, and 7; thus, I do not define 
and discuss it further her In keeping with a dialectical approach however, 
the therapist must remember that he or she does not have a lock on absolute 
truth. Even dialeaical thinking has its limits. One of the dialectical tensions 
in cognitive modification is that between rational and empirical thinking on 
the one hand, and intuitive and emotion-focused thinking on the other On 
the one side, as in more purely cognitive therapies (e.g.. Beck's cognitive ther­
apy), the therapist should value "performing experiments" in the real world 
to test one's assumptions, beliefs, and rules. On the other, the therapist values 
intuitive knowing that cannot be proved in any conventional sense. Function­
al and effective thinking, rather than necessarily "true" or accurate thinking, 
is valued. 
Like any other skUl, learning how to think dialectically and functionally 
requires an active effort on the part of the patient. The therapist can aid this 
effort by judicious questioning within sessions, as well as by giving cognitive 
homework assignments. In the latter, the therapist has the patient keep track 
of dysfunctional thinking during the week, attempt to replace it with more 
--- Page 386 ---
Change Procedures: Part II. 367 
functional thinking, keep a diary or notes, and discuss the efforts during the 
next session. (Forms for this practice are in the accompanying skills training 
manual.) In many cases, the therapist must at first more or less drag more 
appropriate thinking out of the patient. Borderiine patients often say "I don't 
know" when requested to produce new ways of approaching old problems. 
Often, they are simply afraid to reveal more effective ways of thinking for 
fear of being punished or ridiculed. Thus, a fair amount of pushing, cheer­
leading, and shaping may be necessary to get a patient to generate her own 
adaptive thinking styles, rules, and verbal descriptions of events. 
4. DEVELOPING GUIDELINES FOR WHEN TO TRUST 
AND WHEN TO SUSPECT INTERPRETATIONS 
It is crucial that the therapist attend to the patient's tendencies to believe that 
if she is wrong, biased, or distorting in one instance, she must have been wrong 
all along—and will always be wrong in the future. This is, of course, an in­
stance of almost pure nondialectical thinking. But what is the appropriate 
counter to it? The best solution is to help the patient develop guidelines that 
will assist her in determining when she probably should trust herself and let 
other opinions go, and when she might at least check out her perceptions 
and conclusions. 
Some general guidelines of this sort apply to almost everyone. Social-
cognitive and personality psychologists, for example, have spent years study­
ing people's tendencies to be biased in their evaluations and judgments. A 
number of well-known biasing effects that influence people in general, and 
thus are relevant to the task here, are listed in Table 11.7. Each individual 
patient, in addition, will have particular areas in which biasing and distor­
tion are most likely. Thus, besides identifying general areas that must be 
watched, guidelines should also cover the patient's specific biasing tenden­
cies. For example, one patient may make characteristic errors when she is 
extremely angry, or with particular people. Another may be biased primarily 
when sad. Women who suffer from premenstrual syndrome may need to be 
especially careful during the days before their menstrual period. Borderline 
individuals often attend seleaively to rejeaion cues. Feminists may attend selec­
tively to cues that can be interpreted as sexual or sexist. One patient of mine 
who was single and wanted to be married almost never noticed people walk­
ing alone, but could provide almost an exact count from memory of how 
many couples she passed while walking. 
The points are important here. First, the patient should be told that all 
people bias and distort; this does not mean that people can never trust them­
selves. Second, knowledge is power, or at least increases security. Knowing 
when and under what conditions one is most likely to bias and distort can 
be useful in catching and correcting errors. The idea is to normalize rather 
than pathologize information biasing.

368 BASIC TREATMENT STRATEGIES 
TABLE 11.7. Judgmental Heuristics and Biases 
1. People are influenced by the relative avaUability, or accessibUity from memory, of 
events related to a judgment they are making ("availability heuristic"). (Example: 
Subjective estimates of the probability of death from a number of causes are re­
lated to disproportionate exposure to lethal events via media descriptions, as well 
as to their memorabUity and imaginability.) 
2. People base judgments on the extent to which they believe that a specific event 
is prototypical of a larger group of events ("representativeness heuristic"). (Exam­
ple: The tendency to overlook base rates when predicting what someone wiU do. 
For example, in most doaoral programs, over 90% of students admitted eventual­
ly get doaorates. Yet, many students would predict that a student who incurs the 
disapproval of his or her adviser wUl not finish. This overlooks the faa that many 
more students complete doaorates than do not, and that at least some of these 
must have incurred the wrath of their advisers.) 
3 . Initial positions taken continue to influence subsequent judgments even when their 
irrelevance should be obvious ("anchoring heuristic"). (Example: People cling to 
initial hypotheses, even when the evidence on which they were originally based 
has been totally discredited.) 
4 . People favor gathering information that confirms their beliefs, rather than infor­
mation that challenges them ("confirmation bias"). (Example: When people try 
to determine whether another person has a particular personality characteristic 
or tendency, they will typically ask questions that tend to confirm rather than dis­
confirm the characteristic they are testing.) 
5 . People tend to adjust their remembered or reconstruaed probability judgment to 
match present knowledge ("hindsight bias"). (Example: When presented with clinical 
case histories and required to explain a hypothetical outcome, such as suicide, likeli­
hood estimates for this outcome's occurring in faa are systematically increased.) 
6 . Negative mood states produce a consistent negative bias in judgment and estimates 
of bias ("mood bias"). (Example: When in a positive mood [compared to a neu­
tral or negative mood], people will report themselves as more satisfied with what 
they have and wUl rate their own performance more positively, even when perfor­
mance is experimentally controlled by giving false feedback as to success and failure. 
When in a negative mood, people show a global increase in their estimates of the 
subjective probabUity that any of a range of disasters will occur) 
7 . When people imagine an outcome's occurring, they increase their estimated likeli­
hood that the outcome will actually happen ("imagined outcome bias"). (Exam­
ple: People who have imagined being falsely accused of a crime become more 
accepting of the idea that they themselves could possibly be accused in this way.)

Applying Contingency and Skills Training Procedures 
in Cognitive Modifications 
As with all active DBT interventions, the therapist's role in confronting and 
challenging maladaptive thinking styles and content, and in generating new, 
more adaptive and dialectical patterns, should be faded out over time as the 
patient becomes more competent at observing and replacing her own cogni-
--- Page 388 ---
Change Procedures: Part II. 369 
tive errors and biases. At the beginning of therapy, it is often necessary for 
the therapist to "mind-read" (see Chapter 8 for an extensive discussion of 
this topic). During the middle of therapy, the therapist should be pushing 
the patient to observe and describe her own maladaptive assumptions, be­
liefs, or rules, and to generate new ways of thinking. At the end of therapy, 
the patient should be able to think more dialectically and catch her own 
problematic style and content, with little or no coaching from the therapist. 
Principles of contingency management and skiUs training, discussed m Chapter 
10 and earlier in this chapter, should be applied to cognitive modification. 
Integrating Cognitive Skills From Skill Modules 
As noted above cognitive skills are taught in every skill modules. Specific self-
statements are taught in the distress tolerance and interpersonal effectiveness 
modules; clarifying outcomes and appropriate outcomes expeaancies is also 
an important part of interpersonal effectiveness training. Identifying and 
changing evaluative, judgmental descriptions are taught in the mindfulness 
module, as are skills in setting distance and observing. The emotion regula­
tion module includes skills in identifying cognitive appraisals related to emo­
tions. If these skills are taught in skills training, but the individual therapist 
either uses different terminology or simply ignores the skills, they are unlike­
ly to be learned and will do the patient little good. Thus, it is essential to 
DBT that the individual therapist pay very close attention to the cognitive 
skills being taught in skills modules, and build upon and reinforce them. 
Formal Cognitive Therapy Programs 
There is nothing in DBT that prohibits implementing or referring patients 
to formal cognitive therapy programs. As adjunctive therapy programs, espe­
cially for patients who are ready and willing, they may have much to recom­
mend them. Organized, structured cognitive change procedures are not 
included as a formal module in DBT for several reasons. First, in my ex­
perience, focusing primarily on changing how the individual thinks and uses 
information as a solution to her problems is frequently too similar to the in­
validating environment. It is difficult to counter the message that if the pa­
tient would just think right, everything would be OK. Although this is an 
unintended and nondialeaical response to well-carried-out cognitive thera­
py, I have found that it is an extraordinarily difficult objection to overcome. 
Second, formal cognitive therapy generally requires at least some cogni­
tive self-monitoring, writing down thoughts and assumptions, figuring out 
challenges or experiments to test thoughts and beliefs, and actually carrying 
out the experiments. These activities require a number of preliminary skills 
that many borderline patients simply do not have. A program that requires 
a fair amount of independent work at the beginning is not appropriate for 
severely disturbed patients. As cognitive treatment is modified, such that 
--- Page 389 ---
370 BASIC TREATMENT STRATEGIES 
change procedures are carried out with the therapist in therapy sessions, the 
difference between DBT change procedures and many other types of cogni­
tive and cognitive-behavioral therapy lessen. 
Concluding Comments 
In this chapter and Chapter 10, I have reviewed basic cognitive-behavioral 
change procedures and discussed how they can be applied to the problems 
of borderline patients. These four sets of procedures — application of contin­
gencies, skills training, exposure-based techniques, and cognitive modi­
fication—make up the bulk of current behavior therapy. That is, DBT does 
not include much that is new in this respea. It is important for you, the reader, 
to keep in mind, that you can and should add any techniques that you believe 
are effective change procedures or that have been shown in research to be 
effective. That is, you or I could write additional chapters for therapy proce­
dures I have not included. For example, if you are a Gestalt therapist, there 
is no reason not to add Gestalt techniques. In the second and third stages 
of treatment in particular, procedures such as the two-chair technique may 
be very useful. 
When working on specific behavioral problems (e.g., marital or sexual 
dysfunction, substance abuse, eating disorders, or other Axis I disorders), 
you might consider adding procedures that have been demonstrated to be ef­
feaive with those problems. If you are working with an individual who meets 
criteria for multiple personality disorder, you might add some of the tech­
niques that experts in that area have developed to enhance personality in­
tegration or "merging." It is important, however, to integrate other procedures 
in a thoughtful, theoretical consistent manner The prescription here is not 
for switching tactics whenever you get discouraged or immediately trying ev­
ery new technique you hear about. 
Note

ed by Edna Foa (personal communication, 1991), who has developed a number of 
effeaive exposure-based treatment programs.

Stylistic Strategies: 
Balancing Communication 
s 
^^tylistic strategies, as the label im­
plies, have to do with the style and form of therapist communication. They 
focus on how the therapist uses other treatment strategies, rather than on the 
content of communication. Style has to do with tone (warm vs. cool or con­
frontational), with edge (soft and flowing vs. hard and abrupt), with intens­
ity (light or humorous vs. very serious), with speed (fast, quick-moving, or 
interruptive vs. slow, thoughtful, and refleaive), and with responsiveness (vul­
nerable vs. impervious). A therapist's style can communicate attitudes such 
as condescension and arrogance versus respect and affection. 
There are two primary communication styles in DBT. The reciprocal com­
munication style is defined by responsiveness, self-disclosure, warmth, and 
genuineness. By contrast, the irreverent communication style is unhallowed, 
impertinent, and incongruous. Reciprocity is vulnerable; irreverence may be 
confrontational. The two styles constitute the poles of a dialectic. They not 
only balance each other, but must be synthesized. The therapist must be able 
to move back and forth between the two with such rapidity that the blending 
itself constitutes a stylistic strategy. 
Borderline persons are remarkably sensitive to differences in interper­
sonal power and to "games" that therapists play. Often, the majority of their 
life experience has been in a "one-down" position. Many of their interper­
sonal problems are a result of somewhat clumsy attempts to reaify power 
imbalances. The intent of reciprocal communication is to reaify such im­
balances more skillfuUy, and to provide an environment that holds the pa­
tient within the therapeutic enterprise. It is also intended to model for the 
patient how to interaa as an equal within an important relationship. 
Borderline persons have great difficulty getting enough psychological dis­
tance to observe and describe the ongoing events and processes of their lives. 
371 
--- Page 391 ---
372 BASIC TREATMENT STRATEGIES 
Such observation, however, is essential to change. The intent of irreverent com­
munication is to help provide this distance by keeping the individual just off 
balance enough to shake up her typicaUy rigid, narrow-bounded approach 
to life, to herself, and to problem solving. The idea is to highlight both poles 
of the dialeaic without denying either 
RECIPROCAL COMMUNICATION STRATEGIES 
Responsiveness, self-disclosure, warm engagement, and genuineness are the 
four basic reciprocal communication strategies. Reciprocity is important in 
any good interpersonal relationship. It is particularly important within an 
intimate relationship, such as psychotherapy; it is essential in a therapeutic 
relationship with a borderline individual. Reciprocal communication is the 
usual communication mode in DBT. 
Power and Psychotherapy: Who Makes the Rules? 
Patients in psychotherapy often complain that while they can be emotionaUy 
touched and deeply hurt by their therapists, they feel unable to influence their 
therapists in a similar manner. They are vulnerable; the therapists are invul­
nerable. Patients strip naked while therapists keep their clothes on, so to speak. 
Risk is unevenly divided. Patients also hold a sense of their therapists' 
impenetrability—namely, that while the therapists have infinite boundaries, 
they have none. In short, the power in a therapeutic relationship is not only 
unequal; by the very nature of psychotherapy, it is unequal in just those areas 
of a patient's life that count the most. Many of the battles that go on in psy­
chotherapy have to do with this maldistribution of power and patients' at­
tempts to rectify it. 
Although therapists are not nearly as invulnerable as patients often be­
lieve, there is much in the current mores of psychotherapy to account for pa­
tients' dissatisfaction on this topic and for their confusion. That is, although 
therapists might prefer it to be otherwise, patients' complaints are often valid. 
Rules guiding a therapist's behavior and interpersonal style are often arbitrary, 
known to the therapist but not to the patient; as a resuh, the behavior of 
the therapist is not only incomprehensible to the patient but also unpredict­
able. The therapist encourages emotional intimacy within the relationship, 
but the ordinary mles of intimate relationships do not apply Rules of intimacy 
designed for a person engaged simultaneously in many patient-therapist rela­
tionships (the therapist) may be completely inappropriate for a person who 
is engaged in only one (the patient). A therapist is often uncomfortable with 
or theoretically opposed to self-disclosure on his or her own part, while in­
sisting on self-disclosure by the patient. Although the therapeutic relation­
ship is presented as a nurturing and helping one, the availability and flexibility 
inherent in almost all other nurturing relationships are frequently nonexis­
tent or severely diminished. 
--- Page 392 ---
Stylistic Strategies 373 
The borderline patient in therapy is treated similarly in some respects 
to a chUd in a parent-child relationship: She is frequently treated as less quali­
fied than the therapist to make decisions about her own welfare. A child, 
however, eventuaUy becomes an equal of a parent; by contrast, as the patient 
"grows up," her power in the therapy relationship does not necessarily change. 
When that event (equality) appears likely in psychotherapy, the relationship 
may be terminated. 
There is a saying in academia that students stand on their teachers' shoul­
ders. Lineage from teacher to student is traced to show influence. In psy­
chotherapy, however, the mores of the culture conspire to keep the relationship 
secret—something to be ashamed of rather than proud of. Even therapists 
who have been psychotherapy patients themselves often do not disclose this 
information to their own patients. 
Borderline patients in particular are quick to pick up on power differ­
ences and intolerant of arbitrariness in the therapeutic relationship. This may 
be the case because they have suffered so in the past from unequal distribu­
tions of interpersonal power In addition, they often do not have other inti­
mate relationships, in which power is more nearly equal, to balance the 
therapeutic relationship. Many of the problems in psychotherapy with bor­
derline patients have to do with this fundamental inequality. Unable to equalize 
relational power or give up the relationship, they often oscillate between be­
havior that is subservient, needy, and clinging and behavior that is domineer­
ing, dismissing, and rejeaing. They go back and forth between overdependence 
and overindependence. Very few adults are willing to stay for long within in­
timate relationships where their own position of power and influence is so 
limited. The need for a long-term therapeutic relationship places a border­
line individual in a particularly vulnerable position; effeaive therapy requires 
that the therapist be particularly sensitive to this dilemma. 
Reciprocal communication strategies are designed to reduce the perceived 
power differential between therapist and patient; to increase the vulnerabili­
ty of the therapist to the patient, and thereby communicate trust and respect 
for the patient; and to deepen the attachment and intimacy of the relation­
ship (see Derlega & Berg, 1987, for reviews of the literature on responsive­
ness and self-disclosure). The strategies are discussed below and outlined in 
Table 12.1. 
I. RESPONSIVENESS 
"Responsiveness," broadly defined, is the degree to which the therapist ad­
dresses the patient's communications in a manner that indicates interest in 
what the patient is saying, doing, and understanding, as well as concern with 
the substance of the patient's communication, wishes, and needs. It is a style 
indicating that the therapist is listening to the patient and taking her serious­
ly, instead of discounting, ignoring, or overriding what she says and wants. 
Characteristics of a responsive style include the following.

Staying Awake 
Staying awake means keeping attention focused on the patient without en­
gaging in distracting mminations or daydreams, scribbling while listening (un­
less it is necessary to keep notes), allowing interruptions for phone calls, or 
keeping an eye on the clock. The therapist must be particularly awake to 
changes in the patient's mood or emotional response within the interaaion. 
As I have repeatedly noted, a borderline patient's nonverbal emotional ex­
pression is often very subtle and hard to pick up. Thus, the therapist should 
note small changes and should check periodically with the patient on what 
is happening or changing. "What are you feeling right now?" can often be 
useful. Sometimes a few minutes may be needed to explore the effect of the 
current interaction on the patient; changes in therapeutic style or focus may 
or may not be necessary. Although this may momentarily distract from the 
content of what is happening, it is relatively easy to get back on track. Stay­
ing awake is the quality of not missing anything. 
Staying awake also requires an engaged, reciprocal interaction pattern. 
Verbal expressions of emotion, and the intensity of these expressions, as well 
as nonverbal responses (posture, eye contact, smiles, head nods), should vary 
--- Page 395 ---
376 BASIC TREATMENT STRATEGIES 
according to what the patient is saying and doing in a manner that conveys 
aaive involvement in the interaction. 
Taking the Patient's Agenda Seriously 
Responsiveness requires taking the patient's wishes and needs about session 
agenda into account—that is, taking them seriously. Taking the patient's agen­
da seriously, however, does not necessarily mean following her agenda in­
stead of the therapist's. It does mean recognizing her washes openly rather than 
ignoring them, negotiating a compromise when possible, putting her agenda 
ahead of the therapist's if it really is more important, and validating the legiti­
macy of her wishes if the therapist chooses to insist on his or her own agenda. 
Responding to the Content of the Patient's Communications 
Responsiveness requires the therapist to follow the patient's questions with 
relevant answers, to make remarks that relate to what the patient has just 
said or done, and to elaborate or extend the content of what the patient has 
just said. Responding to a patient's question with the counterquestion "Why 
do you ask?" may be therapeutic, but it is not responsive. 
2. SELF-DISCLOSURE 
"Self-disclosure" involves the therapist's communicating his or her own atti­
tudes, opinions, and emotional reactions to the patient, as well as reaaions 
to the therapy situation or information about pertinent life experiences. In 
the psychotherapy literature, therapist self-disclosure is a topic of much profes­
sional controversy. It can also become a point of controversy between patient 
and therapist. Usually, but not always, a patient wants more therapeutic self-
disclosure than the therapist is comfortable with; at times, however, she may 
want less. DBT encourages therapeutic self-disclosure in some instances and 
discourages it in others. Decisions about self-disclosure should always be made 
from the point of view of helpfulness to the patient and relevance to the topic 
under consideration at the moment. 
Two main types of self-disclosure are used in DBT: (1) self-involving self-
disclosure and (2) personal self-disclosure. "Self-involving self-disclosure" is 
a somewhat technical term for the therapist's statements to the patient about 
his or her immediate, personal reaaions to the patient. In the counseling liter­
ature, this is sometimes referred to as "immediacy." In psychodynamic termi­
nology, one might refer to it as a focus on the countertransference. "Personal 
self-disclosure" refers to the therapist's giving the patient information about 
himself or herself, such as information about professional qualifications, so­
cial relationships outside of therapy (e.g., marital status), past or current ex­
periences, opinions, or plans that may not relate necessarUy to therapy or 
the patient. 
Self-disclosure can be used effeaively as part of almost every DBT strategy.

It is part of (1) validation when it normalizes the patient's experience or 
responses by disclosing agreement with the patient's perceptions or interpre­
tations of a situation, understanding of her emotions, or valuing of her deci­
sions; (2) problem solving when it discloses ways of analyzing a problem or 
solutions the therapist has tried for similar problems; (3) skills training when 
the therapist offers new ways of handling a situation drawn from his or her 
own personal experience; (4) contingency management and clarification if 
it is used to disclose the therapist's reactions to the patient's behavior; (5) 
exposure when the therapist's reaaions are ones the patient fears or finds frus­
trating. In addition, self-disclosure enhances the strength of the therapeutic 
relationship by increasing intimacy and warmth. As with all strategies, there 
are a number of guidelines for using self-disclosure wisely. 
Orienting the Patient to Therapist Self-Disclosure 
The utility of self-disclosure often depends on whether the patient expects 
therapist self-disclosure as part of a helping relationship. Patients who have 
been told that professionals and effective therapists do not self-disclose are 
likely to be put off by a therapist's self-disclosure and may view such a ther­
apist as ineffective and incompetent. A patient of mine was referred to me 
after her previous therapist unilaterally terminated therapy. Some time later 
I was going out of town and the patient asked me where I was going. My 
informative response was met with anger and derision: If I was willing to 
tell her where I was going, I was obviously not a good therapist. Her former 
therapist would never have told her! I had not prepared her for the differ­
ences between DBT and psychoanalysis. Although careful preparation may not 
have solved the problem in this case, the therapist should orient the patient 
at the beginning of therapy to the role of therapist self-disclosure in DBT. It 
is useful to find out and discuss the patient's expeaations and beliefs about it. 
Self-Involving Self-Disclosure 
Disclosing Reactions to the Patient and to Her Behavior. In DBT, the 
therapist presents in an ongoing manner, as part of the dialogue of therapy, 
his or her immediate reactions to the patient and her behavior The form of 
self-disclosure here is "When you do X, I feel [or think or want to do] Y" 
For example, a therapist might say, "When you call me at home and then 
criticize all of my efforts to help you, I feel frustrated," or "... I don't want 
to talk to you any longer," or "... I start thinking you don't really want me 
to help you." Following a week when the patient's phone behavior improved, 
the therapist might say, "When you criticized me less on the phone this week, 
I found it much easier to help you." A therapist in my clinic whose patient 
complained about his coolness said, "When you demand warmth from me, 
it pushes me away and makes it harder to be warm." When my patient kept 
begging me to help her but wouldn't fill out the self-monitoring diary cards. 
--- Page 397 ---
378 BASIC TREATMENT STRATEGIES 
I said, "You keep asking me for help but won't do the things I believe are 
necessary to help you. I feel very frustrated, because I want to help you but 
feel you won't let me." "I'm pleased" is a common disclosure of mine when 
patients show improvement, confront something particularly difficult, or do 
something nice for me (e.g., send me a birthday card). "I'm demoralized" might 
be my disclosure to the patient who admits herself to an inpatient unit against 
my advice for the 10th time. 
Self-disclosure of reaaions to the patient serves both to validate and to 
challenge. It is a principal method of contingency management, observing 
limits, and contingency clarification, targeting the patient's behavior in rela­
tionship to the therapist. It is contingency management because a therapist's 
reactions to a patient's behaviors are almost never neutral to the patient. They 
are either positive and reinforce the "X" behavior, or they are negative and 
punish it. As I have discussed in Chapter 10, the therapist's relationship with 
the patient is one of the most important contingencies in working with a bor­
derline patient. Self-involving self-disclosure is the means of communicating 
the momentary state of the relationship. 
Self-disclosure of individual limits, both of ability and of preference, is 
essential to using the observing-Iimits procedures. Here, indeed, the therapist 
is careful to disclose limits as a property of the therapist, of the "self," and 
not as a property of the therapy or of some therapy rule book. Self-disclosure 
is itself a form of observing limits. 
Disclosing reactions to the patient and her behavior is also a means of 
contingency clarification, since it gives the patient information about the ef­
fects of her own behavior To the extent that the therapist's reactions are 
reasonably normative, this information can be extremely important in help­
ing the patient change her interpersonal behaviors. Borderline individuals were 
often raised in families where reaaions to their behavior were either not com­
municated or not normative. Thus, a patient is often unaware of how her 
behavior affects others until it is too late to repair the damage. It is particu­
larly important to give the patient feedback on her behavior early in the chain 
of detrimental interpersonal behaviors, rather than waiting until a reaction 
is so strong that the relationship will be difficult to repair 
"Heart-to-hearts." Self-involving self-disclosure also includes discussing 
with the patient the therapist's experience of what is going on in the immedi­
ate interaction, whether on the phone or in a therapy session. Although this 
is not really very different from disclosing reactions to the patient's behavior, 
the focus here is on the back-and-forth interaaion between the two parties. 
The therapist discloses his or her perceptions of the current interaaion, along 
with his or her own response to it. The form is "It seems to me that X is 
happening between us. What do you think?" For instance, "I'm feeling like 
our interaction is getting more and more tense. Are you feeling it too?" The 
therapist switches the focus of the dialogue to the here-and-now interaaion-
al process. The switch can be very brief (just a passing comment), or can 
lead to an in-depth discussion of the interaction.

Stylistic Strategies 379 
When asked, the therapist should be wUling to discuss with the patient 
where he or she stands in relationship to the patient. In this instance, the ther­
apist reviews with the patient how he or she sees the relationship as a whole, 
instead of focusing on a specific interaction. For example, one of my patients 
missed her therapy session (again) without caUing because she had failed to 
take her antiseizure medications (again), resulting in an admission to the sei­
zure clinic (again). At the next session, she asked whether I was going to get 
upset with her (again). I replied (in essence), "WeU, yes, I guess I wiU. But 
I've noticed that when you do these sorts of things, I get distressed, we work 
it out, and then we go on again. We seem to have a pretty good relationship, 
and both of us can tolerate these ups and downs pretty well. So let's get to 
work figuring this out, and then we can go on to other things." A borderline 
patient often asks direaly, "How do you feel about me?" or "Do you Hke work­
ing with me?" Such questions should be answered directly and clearly. In the 
case above, I might have said, "Right now you drive me crazy, but I like you 
anyway." 
Process discussions are often needed when the patient is engaging in 
therapy-interfering behavior during an interaction. Deciding whether to stick 
to the agenda and ignore interfering behavior or to stop and attend to the 
process can be very difficult. In my experience, if one always stops to discuss 
interfering behavior, almost no other therapy will get done. If such behavior 
is never discussed, however, the same outcome occurs —little or no therapy. 
Interfering behaviors are often avoidance behaviors that function to deflect 
therapy from the task at hand. The therapist has to be very careful not to 
collude in the diversion. Process discussions, in contrast, are usually very rein­
forcing to both patient and therapist and constitute what can be loosely caUed 
"heart-to-heart" discussions. 
Effective use of heart-to-hearts requires that the therapist have a firm 
grasp of their function at a given moment with a given patient. The general 
idea is to use them to advance problem solving or reinforce therapeutic ac­
tivities, and to avoid them when they serve to divert attention from an im­
portant topic at hand. This said, there are several occasions when 
heart-to-hearts are appropriate. 
First, brief heart-to-hearts can be used to break up in-session patient be­
haviors that interfere with work on higher-priority problems. Used in this 
manner, the heart-to-heart is an instance of highlighting (an insight strategy; 
see Chapter 9) and, depending on the level of confrontation, may also serve 
as an aversive contingency (see Chapter 10). For example, a patient may come 
to therapy in a hostUe but passive mood and reject all of my ideas and at­
tempts to solve a problem in therapy. I may ask, "I'm feeling like we are in 
a power struggle, with you trying to get me to be responsible for this problem 
and me trying to get you to be responsible. How are you feeling?" Or I may 
say, "What's going on here? Fm doing the best I can to help with this problem, 
and I feel like you are just sitting back and making me do all the work. So 
I'm trying harder and harder to get you involved. But it doesn't seem to be 
working very well. What do you think? Is that your perception too?" After 
--- Page 399 ---
380 BASIC TREATMENT STRATEGIES 
a brief interaction on the topic (taking care to keep it from digressing to a 
general discussions of our relationship), I then return to the original problem 
at hand. This tactic may be repeated several times during the session ("We're 
getting in a power struggle again"). Always returning to the topic, however, 
is crucial. Otherwise, instigating heart-to-hearts will be an effective way for 
the patient to avoid difficult topics. 
Second, elaborated heart-to-hearts are used as reinforcers. In this instance, 
their timing should be such that they immediately follow some improved pa­
tient behavior, or at least some exposure to the avoided task. For example, 
I may drag a patient through a behavioral analysis and then have a heart-to-
heart about how hard it was. 
Third, elaborated "heart-to-hearts" are used to repair the relationship 
when the therapist has made an error They can also be used to repair the 
relationship when the patient has made an error and wants to work on repair­
ing it. Relationship problem-solving strategies, discussed at length in Chap­
ter 15, are in some respects elaborated versions of a "heart-to-heart." It is 
important here, however, to keep in mind the reinforcing value of heart-to-
hearts for most patients. The therapist must not allow "heart-to-hearts" to 
divert the therapy focus from difficult topics. The balance between heart-to-
hearts and focusing on topics the patient is attempting to avoid is similar to 
the balance the therapist must strike between validation and active problem 
solving. 
Blending Self-Involvement and Responsiveness. As this discussion has 
indicated, self-involving self-disclosure requires the therapist to be alert both 
to the patient and to himself or herself. It requires a certain abUity to be clear 
about one's own feelings and reactions, as well as an abUity to put those reac­
tions into words that the patient can hear Two points are important. First, 
when presenting the situation, the therapist should keep to the "observables" 
rather than presenting inferences about the patient's motives, fantasies, or 
wishes as part of the situation. Such interpretations are part of the therapist's 
own reaction to the situation; they are not part of the situation per se. Saying 
"I feel as if you are playing games with me" is very different from saying "You 
are playing games with me." Second, when presenting reactions, the therapist 
should be careful not to make the intensity too high or too low. For example, 
telling a new patient who is fearful of rejection "I am very frustrated" may 
be better than saying "I am angry." Matching the intensity (though not neces­
sarily the emotion) to the patient's is a good way to start. 
As with all therapist behavior, it is essential to track the effect of self-
disclosing behavior on the individual patient. The goal is for the therapist 
to be able to share with the patient-verbaUy and behaviorally, openly and 
spontaneously-his or her reactions to the patient. This may not be possible 
at the beginning of therapy Disclosure has to be titrated. 
Self-Disclosure of Others' Reactions to the Therapist. Self-disclosure 
about how others react to the therapist can also be important in helping the 
--- Page 400 ---
Stylistic Strategies 381 
patient accept her own reactions to the therapist and the therapist's to her 
The emotionaUy cool therapist mentioned above responded to complaints 
about his lack of warmth by saying (in essence), "You are not the only one 
who feels that way. Other people in my life, in and out of work, have said the 
same thing. I know it would be easier for you if I were warmer, but I am do­
ing my best." Such a self-disclosing and vulnerable response made it very dif­
ficult for the patient to continue her demanding behavior She had no further 
need to validate her experience of the therapist or prove her point that she 
needed more warmth. Instead, she and the therapist could focus on how to 
manage a relationship in which the other person could not give her the warmth 
she wanted and perhaps needed. My patients have complained about many 
of my own interpersonal weaknesses that others also pick up on. Sharing the 
fact that others also complain is immensely validating and refreshing to these 
patients. Sharing the fact that I am working on the characteristic (if it really 
is detrimental and if it is changeable), but doing so without undue guilt or 
shame, suggests a degree of self-acceptance that the patients can imitate. 
Personal Self-Disclosure 
Self-Disclosure as Modeling. DBT encourages personal self-disclosure 
to model either normative responses to situations or ways of handling difficult 
situations. The therapist may disclose opinions or reactions to situations, either 
to validate the patient's own responses or to challenge them: "I agree" or "I 
disagree." This modeling can be especiaUy powerful for patients raised in chaot­
ic or "perfect" families, where the opinions and reaaions to which they were 
exposed were not normative for the culture. Often they are unaware that other 
reactions to events and opinions about the world are not only possible but 
acceptable. 
Similarly, therapist self-disclosure can be useful when the patient's reac­
tions are discrepant from normative reactions, but nonetheless, are valid, are 
admirable, or are otherwise to be encouraged. If both the therapist and the 
patient don't "fit into" to the culture in similar ways, self-disclosure can be 
extremely vaHdating for the patient. The feminist woman in a sexist culture, 
the member of an ethnic minority living within the majority culture, and the 
relational person in an individuated culture are examples. In these cases, it 
is equally important that the therapist disclose how he or she copes with not 
fitting in, such that both self-validation and positive relationships with the 
majority are maintained. 
In teaching behavioral skUls, it can be extremely useful to present a cop­
ing model (rather than a mastery model) of skill application. The therapist 
here shares with the patients his or her efforts, including faUures as well as 
successes, in using the skills being taught. Including faUures can be impor­
tant especially when the therapist goes on to describe the handling of a failure. 
The important point to remember, however, is that although the therapist's 
situation may be similar to the patient's, it is never identical. 
--- Page 401 ---
382 BASIC TREATMENT STRATEGIES 
Self-Disclosure of Professional Information. The therapist should be clear 
with the patient about his or her professional background, training, therapy 
orientation, and views about professional issues. A patient will sometimes 
ask about a therapist's experience in treating BPD and about successes or 
faUures in such treatment. This information should be disclosed, along with 
information about supervision and consultation arrangements. 
Self-Disclosure of Personal Information. Patients are often interested in 
personal details about their therapists, such as age, marital status, children, 
friendship pattems, religion or religious beliefs, work habits, whether the ther­
apists have themselves been in therapy, and so on. Therapists should disclose 
information they are comfortable sharing. The principle here is that as long 
as a disclosure is in a patient's best interest, there are no rules (other than 
common sense and the guidelines above) limiting information given to the 
patient. Some therapists are more private than others; the important point 
is for therapists to observe and disclose their own privacy limits. Unless a 
patient's behavior would be clearly inappropriate in any intimate relation­
ship, a therapist should not communicate to the patient that her wishes for 
more disclosure are pathological. 
A patient will, at times, ask whether the therapist has ever experienced 
personal problems similar to hers. How to respond depends on the therapist's 
actual experiences, how willing the therapist is to be open about his or her 
own life, and whether the information can be used effectively by the patient. 
In some treatment programs, such as many aimed at substance abusers, ther­
apists are seleaed because they have experienced the same problems as their 
patients; sharing this information is thus an important part of the treatment 
program. Women's groups are based on the same notion—that there is a com­
monality of experience between therapist and group members. In DBT such 
sharing is not definitional to the therapy, but it is not proscribed. 
Several points should be kept in mind about this type of self-disclosure. 
First, no matter how similar the situations, the differences between the ther­
apist and the patient may be far greater than the similarities; both the differ­
ences and the similarities should be respected. Second, the therapist should 
be very careful about sharing current problems. Burdening the patient, or put­
ting the patient in the role of "therapist to the therapist" should be avoided. 
These points are discussed in more detail below. 
Using Supervision I Consultation 
Managing self-disclosure is a very difficult task and is one reason why many 
schools of therapy suggest that therapists themselves undergo individual psy­
chotherapy In DBT, the individual supervisor or the case consultation team 
can be essential in helping therapists track their ongoing self-disclosing be­
havior

3: WARM ENGAGEMENT 
Interpersonal warmth and therapeutic friendliness are related to positive out­
come in the research literature on psychotherapy (see Morris & Magrath, 
1983, for a review of this literature in behavior therapy). This is at least as 
true with borderline patients as with other populations (Woollcott, 1985). 
Paradoxically, these patients can elicit both very strong positive and very strong 
negative affect in therapists. On the one hand, the tendency to unchecked 
empathy, warmth, and friendliness (i.e., overly strong positive affea) can lead 
therapists to break the therapeutic contract in favor of nontherapeutic friend­
liness, emotional and physical closeness, and at times role reversal. On the 
other hand, as I have discussed in Chapter 1, borderline patients can be par­
ticularly difficult to like at times. The tendency of many therapists to get an­
gry and hostile, and to invalidate and "blame the victim," is so great that DBT 
actively works to foster liking and motivation to work with borderline pa­
tients. Often, the same therapist vacillates between overinvolvement and ag­
gressively pushing the patient away. (This topic is discussed in much more 
detail in Chapter 13.) 
The middle way, expressing warm engagement, is the usual therapeutic 
stance in DBT. "Warmth" can be defined as the active communication of a 
postive response to the patient. Warm engagement couples the positive 
response to the patient with a positive interest in working with her in the 
therapeutic enterprise. Both voice tone and conversational style should reflect 
warmth and engagement in the therapeutic interaction, as opposed to reluc­
tance and withdrawal. On the phone in particular, the therapist should en­
gage fully in the conversation, being careful that voice tone does not un­
intentionally communicate impatience or annoyance at being interrupted. 
Posture should reflect interest and care. For many reasons (some very valid), 
a borderline patient often believes that her therapist is angry at her, wants 
to get rid of her, finds her boring, or the Hke. Such a patient may dread com­
ing to sessions, fearing a cold, disapproving, or uninterested welcome. One 
of the more therapeutic aspects of this particular guideline is the communi­
cation of warmth and of looking forward to seeing the patient each week. 
A friendly, affeaionate style, rather than a cool, business-like approach is 
the goal here. 
Limits on Warmth 
Warm engagement can be difficult at times, especially when the patient seeks 
additional therapeutic contact, either by phone or through an unscheduled 
office visit. If the therapist is unwilling to talk to the patient at a particular 
point (and there is no immediate crisis requiring attention), he or she can 
offer to talk to her at a later point. Or the therapist can be open about his 
or her reservations, negotiate a brief interaction, and then engage with the 
patient as fully and warmly as possible during this brief period. A therapist 
who repeatedly feels cool, distant, uninterested, or bored with the patient 
--- Page 403 ---
384 BASIC TREATMENT STRATEGIES 
during regular sessions may be sure that something is wrong—with the ther­
apist, the patient, or both. The strategies here are to discuss the topic with 
the consultation team, analyze the interactions with the patient, and employ 
a relationship problem solving. Often, a therapist's unwillingness is a sign 
that the patient is engaging in therapy-interfering behaviors or the therapist 
is not observing his or her limits. 
Some therapists are just not "the warm type"; that is, they are interper­
sonally reserved by nature. Of course, this is no problem with patients who 
do just as well with some distance in the relationship. In contrast, with pa­
tients who prefer or need more warmth, or who misinterpret reserve for lack 
of affeaion, it can be a stumbling block to therapy. The first thing is to remem­
ber the observing-Iimits procedures (see Chapter 10). In this case, the strate­
gy is for a reserved therapist to be honest with the patient about his or her 
ability to express affeaion obviously or directly. Second, the therapist should 
help the patient interpret (and, ideally, experience) other charaaeristics of 
the relationship as indications of his or her friendliness and affection. That 
is, the therapist should try to mitigate the effeas of his or her reserve by high­
lighting other positive aspects of the relationship. For example, a therapist 
who is exceptionally dependable may note that this is a sign of care and af­
fection. Third, the therapist can rely on words to communicate feelings —for 
example, "I like working with you," "I find you interesting," "I'm looking for­
ward to seeing you next week," or "You can call me and I don't mind talking 
to you" (when this is true). 
Coping with Rage at the Patient 
TeUing therapists to express warm engagement is all well and good when the 
patient is not questioning the therapist's competence, credibility, and genuine­
ness during every interaaion; is not overwhelming the therapist with unwanted 
phone calls at all hours; is not threatening to kill herself whenever the ther­
apist makes the slightest misstep or when the therapist is overloaded with 
other concerns; is not threatening to quit therapy every single week; is not 
complaining about the therapist (in ways that feel exaggerated) to anyone who 
will listen; is not rigidly rephrasing what the therapist has just said in a man­
ner that feels distorted and extreme (saying also, "Well, if that is the case, 
I might as well. . ."); is not responding with protracted silence whenever an 
insensitive remark is made; and is not simultaneously failing to improve or 
is even deteriorating despite the therapist's best efforts. But what about when 
the patient is engaging in some or all of these activities, or even worse? Not 
only is it hard to be warmly engaged at these points, but it can also be difficult 
not to retaliate by attacking the patient, I have never experienced or observed 
in other therapists as much rage at patients as with borderline patients. The 
rage is especially intense when the patient is communicating intense suffer­
ing and seems not to be improving. Main (1957), in a beautifully empathetic 
analysis of staff difficulties with recalcitrant distress, has captured the essence 
of the problem as follows: 
--- Page 404 ---
Stylistic Strategies 385 
With recalcitrant distress, one might almost say recalcitrant patients, treat­
ments tend, as ever, to become desperate and to be used increasingly in the 
service of hatred as well as love; to deaden, placate, and silence, as well as 
to vivify.. . . there can never be certain guarantee that the therapist facing great 
and resistant distress will be immune from using interpretations in the way 
nurses use sedatives—to soothe themselves when desparate, and to escape from 
their own distressing ailment of ambivalence and hatred. The temptation to 
conceal from ourselves and our patients increasing hatred [with] frantic good­
ness is the greater the more worried we become. Perhaps we need to remind 
ourselves regularly that the word "worried" has two meanings, and that if 
the patient worries us too savagely, friendly objectivity is difficult or impos­
sible to maintain. 
The first step in overcoming rage is the willingness to "let it come and 
go." That is, the therapist must cultivate a mindful stance of seeing his or 
her own emotional reactions, including rage at the patient, as simply that— 
emotional reactions that come and go. Although any emotional reaction can 
give the therapist important clues to understanding the patient and her difficul­
ties better, little is gained if rage persists. Persistent or very frequent rage is 
usually a clue that some personal issues of the therapist has been tapped by 
the patient's behavior In agency and group practice settings, persistent rage 
may indicate institutional problems as well. Honest self-analyses and use of 
the therapist supervision/consultation strategies (discussed in Chapter 13) are 
essential here. Individual supervision and/or therapy, or consultation outside 
the institution, may also be indicated . 
Rage is invariably based on some sort of pejorative judgment or "should" 
statement about the events eliciting the anger The person engaging in the 
disliked behavior is viewed as responsible, free, and able to act better if she 
only wanted to: "She should not have done that," "She is manipulating me," 
"She just doesn't want to get better," and so on. The biosocial theory of DBT 
was developed in part to counter just these attitudes. Thus, the second step 
in countering rage is to try to change perspeaive, seeing the patient's behavior 
as a result of biosocial factors that have as yet not been remediated. The ther­
apist must move to a phenomenological perspective, seeing events from the 
point of view of the patient. It is when the therapist can hold down both 
points of view at once —the "My response is the only one possible, given my 
life history" view of the patient, and the "Your response is unacceptable 
nonetheless, and must change" view of the therapist—that progress can be 
made in therapy. I have had periods with particular patients when I have had 
to make this shift many times within the space of one interaction with a pa­
tient. Thus, the therapist must have virtually inexhaustible patience in repeat­
ing the process over and over 
Third, the therapist should closely examine his or her own limits with 
respect to the patient's behavior, and question whether these are being ade­
quately observed and communicated to the patient. The observing-Iimits 
procedures, outlined in Chapter 10, were developed primarily to moderate 
therapist frustration and rage. It is rarely useful to communicate these limits 
--- Page 405 ---
386 BASIC TREATMENT STRATEGIES 
in the middle of a rageful reaction; however, once the therapist calms down, 
such a discussion may be fruitful. Unfortunately, with many borderline pa­
tients, the therapist must expand his or her limits for some time until the 
patients' behavior improves. Principles of shaping are essential to keep in mind 
here (see Chapter 10 for a review). In fact, reminding oneself of these princi­
ples can be helpful in reducing anger 
Finally, it is important to keep in mind that perfea control and perfect 
therapy are simply not possible. It is not a catastrophe if the therapist occa­
sionally blows up or engages in hostile or angry behavior That is, it is not 
catastrophic if the therapist repairs the relationship well. This topic is dis­
cussed more fully in Chapter 15, so I do not go into it further here. But it 
can be useful to remember that unrelenting warmth is not a characteristic 
of any relationship, no matter how positive it is. 
Warm Engagement and Touch in Psycotherapy 
A problem with borderline patients is that it is easy to go overboard —to be 
too warm and too engaged. In an effort to avoid that, some therapists go 
the opposite direaion and withdraw too far, both physically and emotional­
ly, from their patients. This is nowhere more true than in the area of physical 
touch in therapy. Many therapists (especially in this era of litigation), have 
an arbitrary rule that they never touch a patient, no matter what the circum­
stances. When it is responsive to an individual's need or request, however, 
touch can be healing in any interpersonal relationship, including the ther­
apeutic relationship. A borderline patient often asks for or initiates physical 
contact or a hug. When this is appropriate, it seems unreasonable to deny 
the request or push the patient away for arbitrary reasons. A good-bye hug 
can be particularly soothing for some borderline patients. The value of touch 
in these instances, at least with some patients, should not be underestimated. 
Even when a session has been appropriately wound down, parting is very 
difficult for many. 
I suspect that the problem here is that the rules are murky but the penal­
ties for violating the mles (whether advertently or inadvertently) are very high. 
If the rules were clearer, things would be easier So what are the rules in DBT? 
1. Physical touch should be careful. Its role in the context of the ther­
apeutic relationship with each specific patient should be clear in the ther­
apist's mind. The relationship of touch to the treatment plan should be con­
scious and explicit. In sum, touch should be thoughtful rather than careless. 
2. Physical touch should be brief. Patting the patient on the shoulder 
as she goes to her chair in the therapy room, hugging her when saying good­
bye or when meeting after some time, briefly putting a hand on the patient's 
hand during a particularly difficult disclosure, and firmly gripping the pa­
tient's hand or arm when she is out of control can all be appropriate and 
therapeutic in certain circumstances.

3. Physical touch should express an existing therapeutic relationship. 
It is a communication strategy; it should not be used as a change procedure. 
Thus, physical contact should be appropriate to the level of therapeutic in­
timacy in the relationship. Within close relationships, touch (e.g., a good-bye 
hug) should reflect the current state of the relationship. It should not be used 
to create a different relationship state. For example, if the relationship is 
strained, touch should not be used to try to repair it. A hug reflects repair 
already accomplished (for both parties); it is not a means of repair Massag­
ing a patient's neck to relax her it not appropriate in DBT. Nor is physical 
contact a validation procedure surrounding a change procedure. Thus, hold­
ing the patient within a therapy session, even during particularly difficult dis­
closures, is not a DBT strategy. The only exceptions here are those rare 
situations where firm physical contact may be helpful or necessary to restrain 
or control a very agitated patient. 
A patient sometimes asks for a hug in farewell or for consolation when 
a therapist does not feel close enough in the relationship to be comfortable 
with touch. This is especially likely with new patients and in therapeutic rela­
tionships marked by patient hostility or nonattachment (e.g., the "butterfly" 
patients discussed in Chapter 5). In such a case, the discussion should focus 
on helping the patient learn to monitor when such requests or initiation of 
touch are appropriate and to act accordingly. Individuals with sexual abuse 
histories often have problems in this area. 
If a patient persists in asking for a good-bye hug that the therapist does 
not feel comfortable giving, he or she should examine how sessions are end­
ing. The therapist may not be giving the patient enough wind-down time be­
fore parting. (See Chapter 14 for a further discussion of this topic.) If the 
patient is forced to leave the interaction when she is too vulnerable emotion­
ally, a good-bye hug may become especially important. Many battles con­
cerning touch center around just this problem. The patient's problem should 
not be ignored, but a hug should not be substituted for appropriate session 
wind-down. 
4. Physical touch should be sensitive to the patient's wishes and com­
fort. The therapist should ask permission before hugging a patient or touch­
ing her hand, and should not touch a patient who does not want to be touched. 
The therapist must be alert to changes in comfort level and act accordingly. 
It should not be assumed that a patient does not care simply because she does 
not protest. Nonverbal communication is important here. 
5. Physical touch should be within a therapist's own personal limits. For 
example, a therapist who is not the "hugging" type with anyone should make 
this clear to the patient, without implying that her wish for physical contact 
is somehow pathological or problematic in principle (see above). As I have 
discussed in Chapter 10, learning to observe others' limits is an important 
social skUl. Or a therapist may not feel safe touching a patient (even when 
it is apparently safe to do so), especially if friends or colleagues have been 
sued or reprimanded for sexual involvement with patients. This concem is 
--- Page 407 ---
388 BASIC TREATMENT STRATEGIES 
most likely in male-female dyads, but can be an equal consideration in same-
sex dyads when one or both parties are lesbian or gay. The therapist may 
want to confine a good-bye hug to open, public places (such as the hallway 
or the office with the door open). Discussing the ethical issues surrounding 
touch with the borderline patient can be very important. 
6. It should go without saying that sexual touch is never acceptable. Nor 
is the expression of sexual wUlingness, by touch, word, tone, or invitation, 
ever appropriate. Borderline patients and their therapists, in particular, tend 
to get into inappropriate sexual relationships; the risks or mistakes of touch 
are higher here than with many other patient populations. Thus, great care 
is needed. The therapist should be particularly careful about how the patient 
construes touch. There is no substitute for talking about how the patient in­
terprets a hug or pat on the shoulder The therapist should not simply as­
sume on the basis of gender and sexual orientation that touch is experienced 
as nonsexual. 
If there is no way for a therapist to touch the patient without its becom­
ing somewhat sexual for either party, no touch should take place. If a ther­
apist is sexually attraaed to a patient (more than briefly), I would recommend 
not only avoiding physical touch but getting a consultation immediately. The 
secret here is not to trust oneself too much. 
7. When inappropriate touch or a sexual overture is initiated by the pa­
tient, the therapist should "talk it to death." Such behavior is therapy-interfering 
behavior and should be treated as such. The therapist should also be willing 
to examine his or her own behavior for inadvertent encouragement or rein­
forcement of such behavior 
8. Physical touch should be potentially public. This does not mean that 
all touch has to occur in public. Nor does it mean that a therapist should 
discuss it publicly with any or all of his or her professional coUeagues. It means 
simply that the therapist should not try to keep the fact of hugging a patient 
good-bye, for example, a secret. The topic should be periodically discussed 
at supervision/consultation meetings. A therapist who videotapes sessions 
should not move out of the camera range when hugging a patient. The pur­
poses of this rule are honesty and self-protection. A therapist who keeps dis­
cussing the topic is much less likely to drift into mistakes. 
4. GENUINENESS 
Almost all experienced psychotherapists and therapy schools value genuine­
ness as an important characteristic of therapists; DBT is no exception. Bor­
deriine patients, in particular, often demand a genuineness from therapists 
that can be exhausting to maintain. These patients can pick up subtie com­
munications, and it is extraordinarily difficult for their therapists to hide be­
hind a role. Having a borderime patient is like having a supervisor for a patient: 
Every artificial response, unartful intervention, inconsistent comment, or at­
tempt to use power inappropriately is noted and commented upon. 
--- Page 408 ---
Stylistic Strategies 389 
Borderline patients often express a need for their therapists to be "real." 
They are frequently uncomfortable with the ambiguity of meaning imposed 
by the therapeutic role. Does a therapist "really care," or is caring behavior 
a reflection of the role? Most other patients tolerate artificial limits and bar­
riers imposed by the therapeutic role; borderline individuals do not tolerate 
them well; in part because their lives have been full of arbitrary rules, limits, 
and distinctions. This does not mean that a therapist should have no barri­
ers. Having no barriers would also be arbitrary. A genuine relationship with­
in the context of therapy allows the patient to learn that even in a good 
relationship there are natural limits and barriers as well as arbitrary ones. 
DBT places a strong emphasis on therapy as a "real" as opposed to a 
transferential relationship. Rather than acting as a mirror in order for the pa­
tient to work out transference problems, the therapist is just himself or her­
self. The therapist develops a real relationship with the patient and helps the 
patient change within the relationship; the idea is that within this genuine 
relationship, healing takes place. The genuineness of the therapist provides 
a vehicle to contain the therapy procedures that bring about change. It also 
provides a counterfoil for the patient to react against and with in order to 
improve her interpersonal behavior Finally, the therapist's genuineness pro­
vides an intimacy and connectedness that enhance the lives of both patient 
and therapist. This quality of being oneself has been described as follows: 
He [sic] is without front or facade, openly being the feelings and attitudes 
which at the moment are flowing in him. It involves the element of self-
awareness, meaning that the feelings the therapist is experiencing are availa­
ble to him, avaUable to his awareness, and also that he is able to live these 
feelings, to be them in the relationship, and able to communicate them if ap­
propriate. It means that he comes into a direct personal encounter with his 
client, meeting him on a person-to-person basis. It means he is being himself, 
not denying himself. (Rogers & Truax, 1967, p. 101) 
In a similar vein, Safran and Segal (1990) discuss the relationship in cognitive 
therapy as follows: 
Ultimately, however, it must be remembered that aU theoretical concepts and 
techniques... are merely tools; they are tools designed to help the therapist 
overcome the obstacles to having an I-Thou relationship with the patient. These 
tools themselves, however, can become obstacles if they are used to avoid 
authentic human encounters, rather than to facilitate them. As an old Zen 
saying puts it: "The right tools in the hands of the wrong man become the 
wrong tools." The wise therapist wUl thus not confuse the particular vehicle 
for change. . .with the underlying essence of change. 
Therapists who let concepts blind them to the reality of what is truly 
happening for their patients in the moment are relating to the patient as an 
object, or in Buber's phraseology, an "It" rather than a "Thou." Therapists 
who hide behind the security of the concepmal framework provided here rather 
than riskmg authentic human encounters, which could lead to therapists' tran­
scending all roles and preconceptions about how they themselves should be, 
rule out the possibility of the very experiences in human relatedness that wUl 
be healing for their patients, (pp. 249-250).

390 BASIC TREATMENT STRATEGIES 
A most important charaaeristic of genuineness has to do with arbitrary, 
role-defined behavior versus natural, congruent, role-free behavior In DBT, 
the therapist does not overemphasize his or her role; that is, effectiveness and 
natural limits rather than arbitrary role definitions determine the therapist's 
response. This naturalness can be quite difficult for therapists trained in 
schools that emphasize strict boundaries and "professional" behaviors. As 
with observing limits, there is no mle book in DBT to indicate what behaviors 
reflea being one self in therapy. Instead, therapists must look to their own 
natural helping style. 
The Need for Therapist Invulnerability 
Some therapeutic approaches take it as accepted fact that the levels of vulner­
ability and self-disclosure for patient versus therapist not only are not but 
should not be equal. In these approaches, the therapist-patient relationship 
is similar to any high-power-low-power relationship. The hallmark of such 
relationships is that one person (the low-power person) is more vulnerable 
than the other As I have noted previously, however, borderline individuals 
are very sensitive to power differences in relationships. They often dislike in­
tensely the quasi-parental nature of many therapeutic relationships, assert­
ing quite rightly that they are not children themselves. They ask why 
vulnerability is not shared more equally. DBT is not based on a medical model 
and actively works against a quasi-parental relationship, or one that treats 
the patient as a child. It is most similar in its relationship model to feminist 
therapy, where the goal is to "empower" the patient. Yet, even in DBT, vul­
nerability and reciprocity are not shared equally between therapist and pa­
tient. Thus, the following question is a very good one: How should the 
therapist respond when the patient contends that reciprocal vulnerability and 
disclosure would enhance treatment, not interfere with it? As one patient said 
to a colleague, "The less you act like a therapist, the more helpful you are." 
There are many answers. In DBT, paradoxically, each answer revolves 
around the therapist's willingness to be natural rather than arbitrary within 
the relationship. Three important reasons have to do with the therapist's per­
sonal limits, particular characteristics of the patient, and the interaction of 
vulnerability with the therapist's ability to conduct effective therapy 
Therapist Limits on Vulnerability 
A primary reason why levels of vulnerability and self-disclosure are not equal 
between patient and therapist is that a therapist can't endure it if they are. 
There is just so much reciprocity any person can tolerate, and no one is com­
pletely vulnerable and open in every relationship he or she in. None of us 
really could sustain that. Most of us are open and vulnerable with one or 
two, or at the most three or four, people in our lives (usually members of 
our families). People without families have one or two close friends they are 
--- Page 410 ---
Stylistic Strategies 391 
vulnerable and self-disclosing with. In general, humans are not reciprocally 
vulnerable with everyone. If therapists were vulnerable in this way with all 
of their patients each day, they would not be able to crawl home at the end 
of the day. 
When a therapist forces vulnerability and self-disclosure for the sake of 
therapy, the interaction is not genuine or authentic. A patient's complaints 
that caring behavior is simply part of the role as therapist are then correct. 
Although the patient may want reciprocal vulnerability, expeaing or demand­
ing it may be unrealistic. A relationship that is authentically reciprocal, self-
disclosing, and genuine can only occur in the context of what the therapist is 
wiUing and able to do or be. It is not necessary to make up rules or come up 
with stories of how reciprocal disclosure and vulnerability would be harmful 
to a patient, even though it may indeed be harmful. It is not necessary to 
convince the patient that the therapist's inability or unwillingness to interact 
as she wishes is in her best interest. Nor is it necessary to assume that the 
patient's needs and wishes for more reciprocity are somehow pathological. 
What is required here is honesty on the therapist's part. When I talk about "re­
ciprocal communication," I am not talking about a therapist's disclosing every­
thing that is going on in his or her life or sharing every reaaion with the 
patient. Instead, I am referring to an openness in the moment, to the moment. 
Patient Characteristics That Limit Vulnerability 
In DBT, the therapist does not build interpersonal boundaries or barriers. 
This does not mean, however, that no barriers and boundaries exist between 
the therapist and the patient; it means that the therapist does not purposely 
build them as a part of the therapy. Observing limits includes observing such 
boundaries, including barriers to vulnerability and self-disclosure. 
A number of patient characteristics and behavior patterns may create 
barriers to intimacy and reciprocity. Borderline patients not infrequently push, 
impinge upon, or demand intimacy and vulnerability from other's including 
their therapists. When this happens, the persons being pushed, impmged upon, 
or demanded pull away and build barriers. It is a natural reaction. It is hard 
to be relaxed and spontaneous with a person who threatens suicide if one 
makes an interpersonal mistake. It is difficult to be intimate with an individual 
who responds warmly one day and engages in bitter attacks the next. Recipro­
cal communication requires the observation of these barriers and the reasons 
for them. The therapist discusses the barriers with the patient, including 
describing how the patient is contributing to them. 
Sometimes there is simply not a good match between patient and ther­
apist. Differences in personality and communication style, social class, gender, 
religion, politics, education, or age, for example, may decrease the therapist's 
comfort as well as the utility of self-disclosure. Reciprocal communication 
is not the tearing down of those barriers but the open acknowledgment of 
them. It is a natural event in life that cultural and stylistic barriers exist be-
--- Page 411 ---
392 BASIC TREATMENT STRATEGIES 
tween people for various reasons. The therapeutic value is that the patient 
can learn about natural barriers in a nonmoralistic, nonjudgmental con­
text. It is not in the patient's best interest to learn that there are no barriers 
ever It is in the patient's best interest to leam about the world as it is. Bar­
riers exist. 
DBT therapists should be open to the fact that much of psychotherapy 
training advocates creating boundaries between patient and therapist. Most 
therapists have undergone such training. Thus, therapists in DBT should con­
stantly explore within themselves how many of the barriers and boundaries 
that exist are artificial and how many are natural, and should work on lowering 
the artificial ones and acknowledging the natural ones. 
Limits of Effective Therapy 
The degree of therapist vulnerability and self-disclosure must also be limited 
by the boundaries between effective and ineffeaive therapy. There are two 
sources of limits: the therapist's previous experience with vulnerability and 
disclosure, and the focus in DBT on the patient. With respect to the first of 
these, DBT requires a sometimes difficult balance between personal experience 
with different patients and appreciation of the individuality of the current 
patient. What is effective with one patient may not be with another What 
was once effective with a particular patient may no longer be. Some patients 
do well within a close and intimate relationship; others become frightened 
and may do better with some distance built in. As with all strategies, there 
is no substitute for ongoing assessment. 
Second, in DBT the focus of therapy should be kept on the patient. Ther­
apists must be careful not to talk about their own feelings or life history in 
a manner that shifts the focus to themselves. Such a shift can be particularly 
tempting with borderline patients, who often make persuasive arguments 
against the inequality and role-dependent norms inherent in psychotherapy. 
Frequently, their desire for greater intimacy, their ability to be nurturing and 
to reinforce therapist self-disclosure, and their tendency to punish interper­
sonal distance lead therapists down a dangerous path to abandoning the ther­
apeutic relationship. A borderline patient's discomfort with the patient role 
sometimes leads to a complete role reversal: The therapist, in effect, becomes 
the patient. At other times, the reversal is partial and the relationship becomes 
one of cocounseling. Although role reversal or a cocounseling relationship 
may not always be detrimental to a patient, both are problematic for a num­
ber of reasons. Neither one was the type of relationship agreed to in the first 
place; that is, each violates the therapy contract. When such a change takes 
place, a patient often finds it extremely difficult to complain, even when she 
wants more attention direaed to her own problems. The patient may also find 
the therapist's problems or life story burdensome. In DBT, self-disclosure 
must be used strategically-that is, within the framework of a treatment 
plan.

Stylistic Strategies 393 
Irreverent Communication Strategies 
Irreverent communication strategies are used to provoke the patient to "jump 
the track," so to speak. The main idea here is to push the patient "off balance" 
so that rebalancing can occur Irreverent communication is used (1) to get 
the patient's attention, (2) to shift the patient's affective response, and (3) 
to get the patient to see a completely different point of view. It is used whenever 
the patient, or both patient and therapist, are "stuck" in a dysfunaional emo­
tional, thought, or behavior pattern. The style is offbeat. 
Irreverent communication indicates to the patient that any idea or belief 
held by either the therapist or the patient is ultimately open to question, ex­
ploration, and change. Logic is used to weave a web that the patient cannot 
get out of. To be effective, irreverence must have two components: (1) It must 
come from the therapist's "center" (i.e., it must be genuine), and (2) it must 
be built on a bedrock of compassion, caring, and warmth. Otherwise, there 
is the possibility for misuse when it is used out of context. Irreverent com­
munication balances reciprocal communication. 
Irreverent communication is difficult to define or explain behaviorally 
and is easier to learn by example or observation. In many instances, it re­
quires a matter-of-faa, almost deadpan style: The therapist takes the patient's 
underlying assumption and maximizes or minimizes it in an unemotional man­
ner (similar to that of a straight man in a comedy team), to make a point 
the patient may not have considered before. By contrast, if the patient is her­
self matter-of-fact or deadpan, high intensity and emotionality or the mak­
ing of extreme statements can also be effeaively irreverent. Whether deadpan 
or intense, the style is in sharp contrast to the warm responsiveness of the 
reciprocal style. ^ Specific irreverent communication strategies are discussed 
below and outlined in Table 12.2 
Dialectical Strategies and Irreverence 
Many (if not most) of the dialectical strategies described in Chapter 7 have 
an irreverent flavor. Indeed, their success often depends on the therapist's 
presenting paradoxical or unorthodox positions as believable and reasona­
ble. Entering the paradox, playing the devil's advocate, extending, allowing 
change, and making lemonade out of lemons are only effective if the ther­
apist presents them with confidence and as completely matter-of-course. The 
therapist uses a "but of course" style, perhaps slightly incredulous that the 
point is not seen immediately by the patient. For example, in extending, the 
therapist incredulously reframes the patient's position: "How could you ex­
pea me to respond to your unhappiness over being fired when you are think­
ing of suicide? Why, of course we have to deal with the suicide first! What 
good is a job if you are dead?" In allowing change, the therapist responds 
to the patient's questions, "Last week you said I have everything I need; this 
week you are saying I don't have the skiUs I need?" with a simple "Right."

ments again?" the therapist says "Yes" and continues on matter-of-factiy 
I. REFRAMING IN AN UNORTHODOX MANNER 
An irreverent response is almost never the reaaion the patient expects. 
Although responsive to the patient's communication, it is nonresponsive to 
the patient's expectations (and, perhaps, immediate wishes). The therapist 
reframes the pattent's communication in an unorthodox manner, or picks up 
on an unintended aspea of the patient's communication. For example, if the 
--- Page 414 ---
Stylistic Strategies 395 
patient says, "I am going to kill myself," the therapist might reply "I thought 
you agreed not to drop out of therapy." 
A patient of mine was failing again in her attempts to keep a job. Figur­
ing (rather realisticaUy) that she might be fired during the next week, she tried 
to convince me that the stress of such constant failure was reason enough 
to kUl herself. She then implied that I didn't know or appreciate how stressful 
it was, since I was obviously a very successful professional. In the center of 
a very intense and emotional discussion, I replied calmly, matter-of-factly, 
and irreverently, "Oh! But I do understand. I have to live with a simUar amount 
of stress much of the time. You can just imagine how stressful it is for me 
to have a patient constantly threatening to kill herself. Both of us have to worry 
about being fired!" Used judiciously, irreverent reframing facUitates problem 
solving and at the same time does not reinforce suicidal behavior. 
2. PLUNGING IN WHERE ANGELS FEAR TO TREAD 
Borderhne individuals are often interpersonally direct and intense. As I have 
said previously, they are not good at social manipulation. They frequently 
relate better to people with a simUar style—those who communicate in a 
straightforward, direct, and clear manner Such a style is part of irreverent 
communication. DBT assumes that borderline patients are both fragile and 
not fragUe; irreverence is directed at patients' nonfragile aspects. Irreverence 
assumes that timing of "interpretations" or hypotheses is not ordinarily cru­
cial. The style of the therapist is direct, clear, concrete, candid, and open. 
The therapist "calls a spade a spade"; he or she plunges in where angels fear 
to tread. Humor and a certain apparent naivete and guilelessness are also 
characteristic of the style. The rationale for this irreverence is the same as 
that for the firefighter who, dispensing with social niceties, throws a fire vic­
tim out the window into the safety net, or for the lifeguard who grabs hold 
of a drowning swimmer to bring her to safety. When pain is intense, time 
is of the essence. Time is saved by taking the direct route. 
Dysfunaional attempts at problem solving and other sensitive topics, 
including suicidal behaviors, therapy-interfering behaviors, and other escape 
behaviors, are accepted as normal consequences of the individual's learning 
history and of factors currentiy operating her life. The behaviors are treated 
as normal consequences of aberrant contexts. The therapist does not step 
back from discussing them or approach them gingerly, but rather plunges 
ahead calmly and resolutely. In particular, suicidal ideation, suicide threats, 
and parasuicide are discussed in a manner simUar to the manner of discuss­
ing any other behavior The possibility that the patient could indeed kill her­
self is acknowledged openly (though not encouraged). This matter-of-faaness 
regularly comes as a surprise to the patient, for whom the behaviors have 
usuaUy elicited a significant community response in the past. The matter-of-
faa style distracts her somewhat from the intensity of the topic and her usual 
strong emotions. The idea is for the therapist to move quickly and naturally 
--- Page 415 ---
396 BASIC TREATMENT STRATEGIES 
enough to pull the patient along. In essence, the response to suicidal behavior 
is to treat it lightly and matter-of-factly, and at the same time to take it com­
pletely seriously. 
Finally, irreverence is surrounded with validation. Thus, if a therapist 
tells a patient that she should not kill herself because it will interfere with 
therapy, this statement is foUowed immediately with a communication that 
she must be feeling terribly frastrated, hopeless, or the like. An irteverent strate­
gy should not be confused with being unemotional. Drama and emotional 
expressiveness are encouraged. 
3. USING A CONFRONTATIONAL TONE 
The irteverent therapist confronts dysfunaional behavior direaly, and at times 
blatantly (e.g., "Are you getting irrational on me again?" or "Are you out of 
your mind?" or "You weren't for a second actually believing I would think 
that this is a good idea, were you?" ). The therapist communicates "bullshit" 
to responses other than the targeted adaptive response. The therapist may 
also use an irreverent style to prevent escape into diversionary dysfunctional 
traumas. For instance, when the patient responds to anxiety-provoking topics 
by diverging into (and persisting in) discussion of another irrelevant trauma 
or "soap opera," the therapist may say, "Do you want help with your real 
problems or not?" or "Oh, no! Another soap opera." As these examples indi­
cate, confrontation depends on a very strong and positive relationship. Nor 
can it stand alone without surrounding validation. 
4. CALLING THE PATIENT'S BLUFF 
The irreverent therapist calls the patient's bluff. For example, if the patient 
says, "I'm quitting therapy," the therapist responds, "Would you like a refer­
ral?" The dialectical strategy of extending—taking the patient more serious­
ly than she wants to be taken —is usually an instance of caUing the patient's 
bluff. The therapist, however, must be careful to leave or provide the patient 
with a way out when her bluff is called. The secret here is in the timing of 
calling the bluff and of providing the safety net. The meek therapist provides 
both at once (bluff and net); the cruel, insensitive, or angry therapist forgets 
the net. 
5. OSCILLATING INTENSITY AND USING SILENCE 
Deliberately oscillating the intensity of emotions, voice, and posture can be 
irreverent when it cuts across the grain of the patient's own intensity Here 
the therapist quickly moves from high intensity to relaxed calmness and back 
again, or from between dead seriousness to playfulness and back again. The 
irreverence is in the oscillation itself, as well as in the incongruity between 
the patient's apparent mood and that of the therapist. 
--- Page 416 ---
Stylistic Strategies 397 
Silence can also be used either to escalate or to reduce intensity, to with­
draw from or to move closer to the patient. For example, the therapist may 
be trying to get a commitment from the patient, a change in affect, or move­
ment from an unreasonable position. After arguing back and forth, the ther­
apist may use silence to encounter the patient and produce a vacuum of 
initiative that the patient may fill. The therapist does not speak, smile, or 
move at all, but gazes at the patient, into space, or at a fixed point. The ther­
apist waits for the targeted response (e.g., one with affect, a commitment, 
a "reasonable" comment) from the patient. Then the therapist responds. 
6. EXPRESSING OMNIPOTENCE AND IMPOTENCE 
It can be very effeaive and irreverent at times for the therapist to assume omni­
potence, suggesting that only by working with the therapist or following the 
therapist's suggestions can the patient make progress. For example, the ther­
apist may say, "The problem with suicide, of course, is that if you are dead 
you won't have me to help you." Or if the patient says, "How do you know 
I have a 'wise mind'?", the therapist says, "How do I know? Take it from me. 
I know these things." Just as effective is the opposite —admitting impotence. 
For example, in response to therapy-interfering behavior the therapist may 
say, "You have won. Maybe this therapy doesn't work for you." Or in discuss­
ing the treatment relationship, the therapist, may admit, "You can beat me 
if you wish. It isn't difficult. All you have to do is lie." When the patient has 
complained once again about the therapist's behavior or her own hopeless­
ness, the response may be "Perhaps you need a better therapist than me." A 
certain element of calling the patient's bluff is evident in these examples. Like 
the cup of sand that contains a nugget of gold, the comment must include 
an element of truth. Irreverence is not a substitute for genuineness. 
Concluding Comments 
Reciprocity and irreverence must be woven together into a single styHstic fabric. 
Used exclusively or in an unbalanced manner, neither represents DBT. 
Reciprocity by itself is in danger of being too "sweet"; irreverence used alone 
is in danger of being too "mean." Reciprocity can be overused by the meek 
or guilty therapist; irreverence can be overused by the arrogant or angry ther­
apist. In DBT, the styles must balance each other Unfortunately, knowing 
this does not give precise guidelines for how to accomplish this blend. 
Although dialeaical theory can guide you, only praaice and a certain amount 
of certainty or self-confidence can produce the rapid movement and blend­
ing that DBT communication requires. Timing of your movements from style 
to style must be based on what is happening in the here and now of the ther­
apy interaaion. You need to keep an eye both on what is happening and what 
is needed—where you are now and where you are going.

Irreverence is usually riskier in the short term. It can produce fireworks, 
sometimes when you least expea them. At other times, irteverence can produce 
a breakthrough after a long period of little progress. Reciprocity, whUe usuaUy 
safer in the short run, can be risky in the long run. Like validation without 
change, it can fail to take the patient's dire situation seriously. In the same 
way that validation is blended with change strategies, reciprocity must be 
blended with irreverence. During some sessions, irteverence will predominate; 
during others, reciprocity will take precedence. As with any skill (including 
those you teach a patient), the craft is frequently in the timing. This can only 
be learned though experience. 
Note 
1. The irreverent communication style in DBT is very simUar to the style of Carl 
Whitaker (see Whitaker, Felder, Malone, & Warkentin, 1962/1982, for a description; 
for an introduction to Whitaker's work in general, see NeUl & Kniskern, 1982). 
Whitaker's sryle, at least as represented on the written page, is quite a bit stronger 
than that recommended here. The style is also similar to the use of paradoxical inten­
tion by some therapists.

Case Management Strategies: 
Interacting with 
the Community 
do with how the therapist reacts to and interacts with the environment out­
side the patient-therapist relationship. These strategies focus on how the ther­
apist responds to other professionals (including other consultants to the 
patient, as well as consultants to the therapist); family members and signifi­
cant others of the patient; and other individuals making day-to-day environ­
mental demands on the patient. Case management strategies do not involve 
any brand-new treatment strategies. Instead, they provide guidelines for how 
to apply dialeaical, validation, and problem-solving strategies to case manage­
ment problems. There are three sets of case management strategies that balance 
one another: consultation-to-the-patient strategies, environmental interven­
tion strategies, and therapist supervision/consultation strategies. 
"Case management" refers to helping the patient manage her physical 
and social environment so that her overall Hfe functioning and well-being are 
enhanced, her progress toward life goals is facilitated, and her treatment pro­
gress is expedited. Thus, whenever problems or obstacles in the environment 
interfere with the patient's funaioning or progress, the therapist moves to the 
case management strategies. With a borderiine patient, problems often arise 
when other professionals or agencies are engaged in ancillary medical or psy­
chological treatment with the patient. The therapist as case manager helps 
the patient manage interactions with other professionals or agencies, as well 
as cope with problems of survival in the everyday world. 
Within the case manager role, issues of autonomy versus dependence, 
freedom versus security, control versus helplessness are central. Generally, the 
emphasis in traditional case management (and in DBT's environmental inter-
399 
--- Page 419 ---
400 BASIC TREATMENT STRATEGIES 
vention strategies) is on interventions by the therapist in the patient's environ­
ment. The case manager from this point of view is the systems coordinator 
and service broker In DBT, the bias is toward teaching the patient to be her 
own case manager (the consultation-to-the-patient strategies). Thus, consul­
tation to the patient is the dominant form of case management, balanced when 
necessary by traditional intervention oriented case management strategies. The 
environmental intervention strategies are used when, because of characteris­
tics of the environment or the patient's abilities, the consultation strategies 
are clearly unworkable and inappropriate. 
From the perspective of managing the therapist, case management has 
to do with helping the therapist apply the DBT protocol in a skillful and ef­
feaive manner. Supervision and consultation in DBT are designed to keep 
the therapist in the DBT frame, so to speak, no matter how strong the tempta­
tion to break the frame may be. In settings with multiple caregivers, the super­
vision/consultation team meets to coordinate and exchange information. The 
team provides the therapeutic community within which the treatment is de­
livered, and balances the therapist in his or her interaaions with the patient. 
Put most simply, the environmental intervention strategies involve tak­
ing care of the patient, conveying information about the patient to others on 
the patient's behalf, giving others advice on how to treat the patient, and in­
tervening in her environment to make changes. The consultation-to-the-patient 
strategies involve assisting the patient in accomplishing these same tasks for 
herself—taking care of herself, conveying information about herself to others, 
advising others on what she needs and wants, and making changes in her 
own environment. The therapist supervision/consultation strategies involve 
exchanging information about patients therapists are treating jointly, taking 
care of one another, giving one another advice on treatment planning, and 
consulting with one another in how to make beneficial changes in the treat­
ment environment. 
In each set of strategies, treatment coordination across settings and 
providers is valued. In each set of strategies, inclusion of the family and so­
cial network in the therapeutic work is welcomed and encouraged. In each 
set of strategies, the safety, welfare, and long-term progress of the patient are 
paramount. What differs is the way the therapist goes about reaching these 
goals in each case. 
It is extremely important to keep in mind the spirit of the case manage­
ment strategies-teaching the patient to manage her own life (including her 
social and health care network) effectively in an environment that is not un­
necessarily risky or unsafe. Decisions about how the therapist should inter­
act with others flow from the spirit rather than the letter of the law. It is 
especially difficult to ascertain ahead of time all of the potential difficulties 
in situations where they might come up. Indeed, a significant function of the 
therapist supervision/consultation strategies is to assist the therapist in the 
balance of the other two sets of strategies in each particular instance.

Case Management Strategies 401 
ENVIRONMENTAL INTERVENTION STRATEGIES 
Although the main goal of DBT is to get the patient active in solving her own 
Hfe problems (the basis of the consultation-to-the-patient strategies), at times 
an issue is so important and/or the patient's abUity to intervene on her own 
behalf is so limited that intervention by the therapist is necessary. Environ­
mental intervention strategies are used instead of consultation-to-the-patient 
strategies when (1) the outcome is essential and (2) the patient clearly does 
not have the power or the capability to produce the outcome. "Essential" in 
this context generally means avoiding substantial harm to the patient. The 
environmental intervention strategies are also sometimes needed when the en­
vironment has high power relative to the patient; in such a case, the therapist 
may step in to equalize the power distribution. 
The rule in DBT is that direct or unilateral interventions by the therapist 
should be kept to the absolute minimum consistent with the well-being of 
the patient. The therapist intervenes only when the harm to the patient of 
not intervening outweighs the harm (short- and long-term) of intervening on 
her behalf. Furthermore, when the therapist does aaively intervene, the degree 
of unilateral intervention should be at the lowest level possible. Thus, when 
the therapist is consulting with other professionals or family members, the 
patient not only should be present but should be encouraged to be as active 
as possible in the consultation. If the patient cannot be present but the inter­
vention is nonetheless absolutely necessary, a complete summary of the in­
tervention should be given to her as soon as possible. It goes without saying 
that whenever possible, the patient should be informed about the interven­
tion before it takes place. Indeed, except in emergencies where there is a risk 
of suicide, serious self-injury, or violence to others, the patient must give in­
formed consent before interventions take place. 
Case Management and Observing Limits 
In many settings, it is usual for patients to have both a case manager and 
a psychotherapist. In these settings, most of the case management interven­
tions can and should be conducted by the case manager rather than by other 
therapists on the treatment team. If a large amount of such assistance is neces­
sary in other settings, the therapist might want to consider with the patient 
the possibilities for obtaining a case manager When the patient has a desig­
nated case manager, the role of other therapists, including the primary ther­
apist, is to assist the patient in using those services appropriately. Although 
it is appropriate in DBT for the individual therapist also to perform tasks 
traditionally associated with case management, the personal limits on time 
and energy of the therapist will probably constrict the therapist's own abili­
ties here.

402 BASIC TREATMENT STRATEGIES 
Conditions Mandating Environmental Intervention 
Intervening When the Patient Is Unable to Act on Her 
Own Behalf and the Outcome Is Very Important 
At times the patient is unable to act in her own best interest, no matter how 
well she is coached. The patient who is in a transient psychotic state or un­
conscious from a drug overdose is an example. Or a problem situation may 
require so many new behaviors, that principles of shaping dictate that the 
patient act for herself and the therapist act for her also. An adolescent pa­
tient in our program had been making very slow but very steady progress. 
She was suddenly accused of a particularly humiliating crime—which as far 
as we could tell, she did not commit. When her foster parents, whom she 
depended on, believed that she committed the crime and asked her to move 
out, she dissociated, depersonalized, and became extremely suicidal. Her his­
tory in such situations was to cope by cutting herself, sometimes to such an 
extent that she needed up to 100 sutures. She agreed to go onto a psychiatric 
inpatient unit rather than harm herself, but otherwise was in apparent psy­
chological shock. To assure timely admission, the therapist consulted direct­
ly with the admissions coordinator, giving needed information for a decision 
about admission and placement. The plan was that the patient would use 
the hospital stay to integrate the crisis and find a residential treatment home 
to move to. Once admitted, however, the patient withdrew and would not 
talk at all to the staff members, who did not know about the events leading 
up to the crisis. They were at a loss as to how to help her The therapist inter­
vened and consulted by phone (with the patient's permission, but not in her 
presence) with the staff about the patient. The therapist continued to inter­
act intermittently with inpatient staff by phone until the patient could begin 
intervening on her own behalf. 
At times a patient may be admitted to an emergency room in a coma, 
or in substantial medical danger or risk. Knowing the patient's medications 
can be crucial. The therapist provides needed information if the patient can­
not, and validates (or corrects) information the patient has given about her­
self, her medications, and her treatment course. 
Intervening When the Environment Is Intransigent and High in Power 
At times the problem is an intransigent, high-power environment. For exam­
ple, mental health professionals are often unwilling to modify their treatment 
of a patient unless a high-power person intervenes, no matter how skilled the 
patient may be at interacting with them. At the beginning of our treatment 
program, I had to call most hospitals in the metropolitan Seattle area to let 
them know that yes, what the patients said was true. I did expect patients 
to get a pass to come to therapy even when they were on an inpatient unit. 
And, yes, it was true that if they missed 4 weeks of scheduled therapy in a 
row they were out of our treatment program. 
--- Page 422 ---
Case Management Strategies 403 
Similarly, insurance companies may be unwilling to pay for therapy 
without a diagnosis and treatment plan from a therapist, no matter how skUled 
the patient is in her interaaions with the insurance company. PubHc assistance 
programs may require therapist reports to maintain benefits. Therapist refer­
ral phone calls, and consultations with the admitting officer, can be very use­
ful (and sometimes necessary), in getting a patient admitted to an acute 
psychiatric unit. A scared inpatient staff may be ready to commit a suicidal 
patient involuntarily to the state hospital even when it is not in the best in­
terest of the patient, unless the therapist intervenes. 
Intervening to Save the Life of the Patient or 
Avoid Substantial Risk to Others 
Closely related to a patient's inabUity to intervene on her own behalf is a pa­
tient's unwillingness to do so. Although a therapist does not usually inter­
vene in these cases, when there is substantial risk of harm to the patient (such 
as high risk for suicide), the therapist may actively intervene to safeguard the 
patient. Similarly, as in all therapies, the therapist must intervene if the pa­
tient poses significant risk to the welfare of a child or another person. State 
laws, and professional guidelines and ethical standards, must be adhered to. 
Interventions to prevent suicide are discussed in greater detail in Chapter 15 
and are not discussed further here. 
Intervening When It Is the Humane Thing to Do 
and Will Cause No Harm 
At times a problem is a blend of a intransigent environment and temporary 
patient inability. For instance, a patieint is on her way to therapy and her car 
unexpeaedly breaks down. The car problem cannot be fixed immediately. 
The patient has no money with her for a bus or cab. She is unable to find 
altemative transportation in time to make her appointment. She calls the ther­
apist, who has time and goes and picks her up. The rule here is that the ther­
apist does for the patient what he or she might do for any friend in a simUar 
situation, as long as this does not entail helping the patient substitute passive 
for active problem-solving behaviors. In contrast to typical psychotherapy, 
but simUar to most forms of case management, DBT does not dictate that 
interventions be confined to a therapist's office. Instead, the therapist may 
intervene by going to a patient's home during a crisis, the roadside if her car 
breaks down, or the housing authority if she needs a coach to guide her 
through the administrative complexity of this agency. 
However, when the problem is a lack of abUities the patient needs to 
learn, the therapist only intervenes in exceptional circumstances (not everyday 
crises). That is, the therapist does not intervene on a regular basis. An abil­
ity to tolerate the patient's distress and mishaps until she acquires requisite 
skills is, therefore, necessary. When the problem is the patient's lack of abili-
--- Page 423 ---
404 BASIC TREATMENT STRATEGIES 
ties that are either not possible to obtain (such as learning to get insurance 
companies to pay without a therapist's report) or not reasonable or neces­
sary (such as leaming to get broken down cars going), the therapist intervenes. 
Intervening When the Patient Is a Minor 
DBT has not been used by my treatment team for treating patients younger 
than 15 years. For a minor, both legal and practical considerations can re­
quire that the therapist suspend the role of consultant to the patient under 
certain circumstances. In particular, it may be very important to work with 
parents, guardians, or teachers of a minor patient. Although the usual policy 
in DBT is to intervene with the patient present, this may not be praaical or 
always useful with a very young adolescent. Even when the minor is present, 
it may be necessary for the therapist to be far more active than the patient. 
Finally, legal requirements for reporting chUd abuse generally require that the 
therapist intervene and contact authorities in all instances of such abuse. 
Specific environmental intervention strategies are described below and 
listed in Table 13.1. 
I. PROVIDING INFORMATION INDEPENDENTLY OF THE PATIENT 
Providing information to others is one of the most common forms of environ­
mental intervention in the mental health community. Medical records, intake 
and discharge summaries, and test results are routinely sent to other profes­
sionals treating a patient. Phone consultations to plan therapy, to coordinate 
benefits, or to get advice in a crisis are more or less routine in most treatment 
settings, the crucial thing to remember in any therapy, including DBT is that 
information should be given on a need-to-know bases only. Confidential and 
personal details of therapy, private confidences, and information that would 
embarrass or humiliate a patient if made public should be kept confidential. 
Pejorative descriptions, motivational inferences without supporting data, and 
other characterizations of the patient that might have a negative influence 
on others' attitudes towards the patient should be strictly avoided. 
2. PATIENT ADVOCACY 
In patient advocacy, the therapist acts on behalf of the patient to arrange an 
outcome favorable to the patient or to influence others' treatment of the pa­
tient. Examples include sending required treatment rationales and progress 
reports to maintain the patient's medical benefits; calling insurance compa­
nies to work out billing problems; advocating the patient's acceptance into 
a treatment or residential program; working to keep the patient off involun­
tary treatment status (or on such status); getting her released from an in­
patient program; and the like. Advocacy is done only when absolutely 
necessary.

3. ENTERING THE PATIENT'S ENVIRONMENT 
TO GIVE HER ASSISTANCE 
Many borderiine individuals live very isolated lives; they often have difficulty 
buUding and sustaining a supportive interpersonal network. They may not 
have family members nearby, or relationships with nearby family members 
may be severely strained. Friends may be few or unable to provide useful as­
sistance when needed. Not uncommonly, a patient is unable to find anyone 
--- Page 425 ---
406 BASIC TREATMENT STRATEGIES 
other than the therapist to call on for help in a crisis. In these cases, the ther­
apist can reach out and directly help the patient if conditions discussed above 
are met. For example, the therapist may at times take the patient to the emer­
gency room or hospital if she is severely suicidal; may go with her to assist 
with specific tasks when the patient is so phobic of the task that she cannot 
do it alone; or may give her a ride home after therapy if she misses the last bus. 
At times the patient needs more than advice and coaching from afar, but 
is not incapable of working on her own behalf. As Kanter (1988) has put 
it, the case manager (here, the DBT therapist) sometimes functions not only 
as a "travel guide" but also as a "travel companion" to ease the loneliness 
of the patient. The loneliness that DBT seeks to ease is the loneliness of ac­
tive problem solving without ready access to help should the need arise. Thus, 
the therapist sometimes goes with the patient to give moral support. The model 
for this approach in behavior therapy is in vivo exposure treatment, where 
the therapist ordinarily accompanies the patient in her attempts to enter fearful 
situations within her everyday environment. As I have noted earlier in this 
book, the DBT therapist often sticks to the patient like glue, whispering en­
couragement and advice in her ear. It is important, however, to keep clear 
the difference between coaching and giving moral support, and taking over 
for the patient. The latter is done only in exceptional circumstances. 
CONSULTATIONTOTHE-PATIENT STRATEGIES 
Consultation-to-the-patient strategies are simple in concept and very hard to 
carry out. The concept is this: The primary role of the DBT therapist is to 
consult with the patient about how to interact effectively with her environ­
ment, rather than to consult with the environment on how to interact effec­
tively with the patient. The borderline individual is the patient, not the system 
or network. The therapist therefore functions as a consultant to the patient 
rather than to the patient's network. For problems the patient has with her 
network, the therapist engages in problem solving with the patient; the net­
work is then left for the patient to manage. 
With some exceptions, health professionals providing anciUary treatment 
to DBT patients are viewed much as other persons in the patient's life are 
viewed. In my experience, this aspect of DBT-the style of interactions with 
ancillary professionals-is one of the most innovative aspects of the treat­
ment. It can be difficult to implement because it is counter to how health 
professionals are trained to treat health problems. Most communities devote 
a fair amount of their health care resources to trying to coordinate and inte­
grate treatment for individuals in the health care system. DBT is not opposed 
to this view; in general, coordinated care is probably better care. The differ­
ence is in how DBT views its own role in coordinating care. 
In this section, I first discuss the rationale or spirit of the consultation-
to-the-patient strategies in general. Next, I outiine specific consultation strate-
--- Page 426 ---
Case Management Strategies 407 
gies. Finally, I discuss more explicitly the arguments against the consultation 
approach and the reasons why this approach was chosen nonetheless over 
the more standard approach to consulting with the medical and mental health 
community. I hope to convince you to give this approach a try. 
Rationale and Spirit of Consultation to the Patient 
The consultation-to-the-patient approach was chosen with three objectives 
in mind: (1) to teach patients to manage their own lives; (2) to decrease in­
stances of "splitting" between DBT therapists and other individuals interact­
ing with the patients; and (3) to encourage respect for the patients. 
Teaching Effective Self-Care 
The first consideration was to have a policy that would funaion as the oppo­
site pole to borderline patients' preference for avoidance of problem solving. 
Frequently, these patients use indirect over direa means of interpersonal in­
fluence. They not infrequently try to get their therapists to intervene for them 
in interpersonal difficulties. The consultation strategies are geared toward con­
sistently requiring active solutions by patients. This seems essential, since ther­
apists cannot solve all environmental problems encountered now or in the 
future by their patients. 
There are two competing needs here. On the one side is the need for 
information by all individuals treating or interacting with a patient. Health 
professionals, as well as family members, work associates, and friends, will 
aU respond more effeaively to a patient they know and understand. The ther­
apist's providing of information increases understanding of the patient. On 
the other side is the patient's need to learn to interact effectively with other 
individuals (including health professionals), to take care of and for herself, 
and to increase her own abilities and self-confidence. The consultation strate­
gies target this. Thus, in DBT the therapist is willing to let the patient suffer 
some of the short-term negative consequences of ineffeaive self-care for the 
sake of long-term improvement in self-care. When the immediate consequences 
of the consultation strategies would be too severe, the therapist switches to 
the environmental intervention strategies. 
Implicit in this approach is a belief in the patient's capacities to learn 
to interact effeaively. In DBT, the patient is the responsible party in interac­
tions with others. The approach is based on the belief that the therapist's 
job is to help the patient cope with the world as it is, with all its problems 
and inequities—not to change it for the patient. Rather than intervening for 
the patient in solving problems or getting what the patient needs or wants, 
the therapist teaches and coaches the patient in how to resolve problems and 
get what she wants and needs. Adversity and "bad" treatment of the patient 
by the environment are viewed as opportunities for practice and learning: in 
other words, lemons are used for making lemonade. The patient is taught 
to "manage" the environment, not to submit passively to it. 
--- Page 427 ---
408 BASIC TREATMENT STRATEGIES 
Decreasing "Splitting" 
The phenomenon of "splitting" occurs with regularity in the lives of border­
line patients. Splitting occurs when different individuals in a patient's net­
work are at odds over how to interact with or respond to her. Parents may 
be split; for example, one parent may want to continue giving the patient 
free room and board, whUe the other insists that the patient start paying her 
share of household expenses. Friends may be split, with some believing that 
others are behaving in mean-spirited or destruaive ways. The patient's wom­
en friends may blame her spouse or partner for her troubles, and vice versa. 
In "staff splitting," health professionals treating the same patient not only dis­
agree about treatment methods and priorities, but do so vehemently. (This 
is discussed in more detail later in the chapter) 
The consultation-to-the-patient approach was developed to reduce split­
ting. By remaining in the role of a consultant to the patient, the therapist 
avoids becoming entangled in the often contradiaory positions taken by others 
involved with the patient. Disagreements on how to respond to the patient 
are viewed as opportunities for the patient to learn how to stand up for and 
think for herself, to integrate divergent advice, and generally to take respon­
sibility for her own life and welfare. By staying out of arguments about how 
others should respond to the patient, the DBT therapist avoids taking part 
in and contributing to splitting. 
Promoting Respect for the Patient 
FinaUy, the consultation approach promotes respect for the patient and her 
capabilities, which is consistent with the stance of DBT in general. The mes­
sage sent to the patient is that she is a credible source of information and 
can intervene effectively in her own behalf within her own social and health 
network. Although it is not unusual for "experts" to consult with one another 
about cases they are working on (whether the area is education, law, medi­
cine or psychotherapy), such consultation, when conducted in the absence 
of the person involved in the case, sends one of several messages. It may im­
ply that the means of achieving the individual's goal is too complex for her 
to understand, that the individual's opinions and wishes are not necessarily 
important, or that the individual's input is not trusted. The consultation strate­
gies consistentiy suggest that the patient's wishes and opinions about her own 
welfare are to be trusted. The approach includes teaching, with one aim be­
ing to demystify the process of behavioral and psychological change so that 
the patient can become a better advocate in her own behalf. 
The "Treatment Team" versus "Everyone Else" 
There are several variations on the consultation-to-the-patient approach. The 
variations depend primarily on whether the person needing information or 
consultation is a part of the therapy team or not. In principle, all anciUary 
--- Page 428 ---
Case Management Strategies 409 
therapists can become part of the DBT treatment team. The only require­
ments for a therapist's being on the DBT team are these: (1) The patient agrees; 
(2) the therapist agrees to apply DBT principles to treatment; and (3) the ther­
apist attends regular DBT supervision/consultation meetings. DBT was de­
veloped as an outpatient treatment provided in a research clinic where all ther­
apists were committed to providing DBT. This setting is duplicated in inpatient 
and outpatient units where a special DBT treatment program (or program 
within a program) is instituted. It is duplicated when a small group of practi­
tioners provides joint treatment for a number of borderline patients (e.g., one 
or more therapists provide individual psychotherapy but then coordinate with 
one or more other therapists who provide skills training). And, it is duplicat­
ed in settings where solo practitioners treat borderline patients but then meet 
regularly with colleagues for DBT supervision/consultation. In settings where 
a patient is treated by a team, but only one or a few of the team members are 
applying DBT, the consultation strategies probably cannot be applied as strialy 
as I describe them here unless all members of the team can be persuaded to 
go along with the DBT case management philosophy, at least. 
By definition, members of the treatment team consult among themselves 
on a regular basis, exchanging information about the patient, as well as their 
reactions to and interactions with the patient. By definition, people outside 
of the team (i.e., everyone else) do not share information on a regular basis. 
Members of the team are treated like family members. All have agreed to con­
fidentiahty rules, and all are interested in applying the same treatment prin­
ciples to patients and therapists alike. Information given will be interpreted 
in a reasonably predictable way. Nonmembers of the team are treated like 
friends. They are not assumed to be applying the same rules to the patient 
as the DBT team, nor is it clear how shared information will be interpreted 
and used. Although the general principles and phUosophy of the consultation-
to-the-patient approach are the same for the DBT team and everyone else, 
the specific strategies differ These differences are important. 
Specific consultation strategies are listed in Table 13.2 and are described 
below. 
I. ORIENTING THE PATIENT AND 
THE NETWORK TO THE APPROACH 
When first introduced in Seattle, the consultation-to-the-patient approach was 
quite controversial within the local community. A fair amount of community 
orientation was needed, and the idea took some getting used to. Both a pa­
tient and members of her network must be oriented to the consultation ap­
proach. The first time the therapist refuses to intervene for the patient, the 
therapist and patient should discuss why this is being done and how treating 
the patient like a competent person will, in the long run, be in her best in­
terest. An irreverent style-irreverence about the patient's presumed fragility 
or incompetence to manage-can be very useful here. A patient is often afraid

that she will be thrown to the wolves and left to fend for herself. Consulta­
tion is not that; the therapist will be right next to the patient every step of 
the way. This orientation may have to be repeated a number of times. 
With other professionals, the best policy for the therapist is simply to 
attribute his or her stance to the rules of the therapy, and to explain to them 
the consultation approach. I generally say something like this: I am applying a 
specific therapy, which requires that whenever possible, I teach the patient to 
intervene for herself rather than doing it for her I may point out that border-
Hue patients often have enormous difficulty interaaing effeaively in the health 
system. Because of that, I am focusing my energy on teaching the patient how 
to be more effective. I point out that I am very wUHng (and, indeed, may 
be eager) to consult with another professional with the patient present. 
The trick is to get the other professionals to see that it is in their long-
term best interest for the therapist to work with the patient instead of with 
them. In my experience, once community professionals get used to this poli­
cy, they don't mind. It takes some getting used to, however, and the other 
professionals need a bit of validation along the way. With recalcitrant profes­
sionals, a therapist may occasionally have to abandon the consultation strate­
gies and move to the environmental intervention strategies. 
2. CONSULTATION TO THE PATIENT ABOUT HOW 
TO MANAGE OTHER PROFESSIONALS 
The essence of consultation to the patient is this: The role of the therapist 
is to consult with the patient about how to manage other people, rather than 
to consult with others about how to manage or treat the patient. The task 
of each DBT therapist is to help the patient interact more effeaively with all 
--- Page 431 ---
412 BASIC TREATMENT STRATEGIES 
members of her interpersonal network, including other medical and mental 
health professionals—whether they are members of the DBT treatment team, 
or anciUary therapists treating the patient. As a general rule (and with the 
exceptions described earlier), a DBT therapist does not intervene to adjust 
the environment, including the treatment the patient received from other 
professionals, for the sake of the patient. In sum, this strategy is a prescrip­
tion ("Tell the patient what to do with professionals") and a proscription ("Do 
not tell other professionals what to do with the patient") coupled together 
There are several; corollary strategies or general rules that flow from this one 
strategy, as follows. 
Corollary 1: Give other professionals general information about the treat­
ment program. Consultation to the patient does not preclude the therapist 
from giving to other people general information about DBT, the therapist's 
philosophy of treatment, the therapist's individual or program limits, and be­
havioral principles underlying DBT. Although the therapist does not speak for 
the patient, the therapist can and does speak for himself or herself and for the 
program as a whole. On the phone, by letter, or in joint meetings with other 
professionals and the patient, the therapist explains his or her own point of 
view. 
Corollary 2: Outside of the treatment team, do not discuss the patient 
or her treatment without the patient present. With the exceptions discussed 
above under environmental intervention strategies, the therapist does not in­
teract independently of the patient with individuals not on the DBT treat­
ment team. That is, the therapist takes no part in phone conferences, sends 
no reports, and attends no meetings or case conferences without the engage­
ment of the patient. Even when the patient gives permission and interchange 
with professionals is necessary, information is not shared unUaterally; the ther­
apist and patient compose letters and reports collaboratively and attend meet­
ings together Any necessary call to anciUary therapists or other persons 
involved with the patient is first discussed with the patient in the room dur­
ing the consultation. A speaker phone is very useful here. When the therapist 
is coordinating backup care while he or she is out of town, the backup plan 
is developed with the patient, and the patient is given the task of calling the 
backup professional before the therapist leaves town to review the plan. Typi­
cally, of course, the therapist (after consulting with the patient) wiU have made 
prior arrangements with colleagues for backup coverage. Depending on the 
patient, the therapist may also want to double-check the backup plan with 
his or her colleague before leaving. 
Therapists and staff members do not ordinarily write courtesy or refer­
ral letters introducing their patients. It is assumed that a patient can introduce 
and speak for herself. If such a letter is necessary or useful, the patient and 
therapist write the letter jointly Information that needs to be given to the 
new professional is transmitted through the patient. It is presumed that the 
patient can summarize her problems, treatment to date, and current needs, 
--- Page 432 ---
Case Management Strategies 413 
at least with coaching from the DBT team. If she cannot speak for herself, 
a joint meeting with the patient present is arranged. 
Corollary 3: Within the treatment team, share information but keep the 
spirit of the strategy. All DBT therapists working with a particular patient 
meet weekly in the supervision/consultation team to review and discuss the 
patient's progress. The patient is not present. A primary goal of these meet­
ings is to share information that can then be used in working with the pa­
tient, and to obtain treatment consultation based on this shared information. 
In these instances, the entire team is considered the therapeutic unit (even 
if only one therapist is actually meeting with the patient). Information is 
gathered from all parts so that the unit as a whole can teach the patient. The 
consultation-to-the-patient approach is violated in this context when the ther­
apist does for the patient what the patient can (or can learn to) do for her­
self. Information is shared to guide treatment planning, not to communicate 
for the patient. 
Corollary 4: Do not tell other professionals how to treat the patient. Ex­
cept as required by the environmental intervention strategies (see above), the 
patient serves as her own intermediary between the treatment team and an­
cillary professionals and other individuals in her network, as well as between 
the therapist and all other individuals. With ancillary professionals, the DBT 
therapist's usual response for treatment guidance is some variation of the com­
ment "Follow your usual procedures." Within the treatment team, the ther­
apist may assist other team members in thinking through various treatment 
options, and may provide information about the patient that wUl be useful 
in this planning, but in the final analysis, the advice is still the same: "Follow 
your usual DBT procedures." 
This rule is followed even when the ancillary treatment may have a sig­
nificant impact on the therapist's treatment. Here is an example. A patient 
in DBT is leaming assertion skiUs in the interpersonal effeaiveness skiUs train­
ing module. The patient has great difficulty standing up for herself; she is 
either very aggressive or very passive. Her individual therapist will not ac­
cept caUs after 9 P.M. at home. The patient works until 8:30 P.M. and doesn't 
get home untU after 9. She wants her therapist to change the cutoff time to 
9:30. She has already tried demanding and verbal aggression, to no avail. 
She comes to skiUs training complaining about her therapist. The skills trainer 
works with her on developing a more skillful approach. The patient agrees 
to try it at her next therapy session. The trainer fervently wants her new, more 
skillful behavior to be reinforced. At a supervision/consultation meeting be­
fore the individual therapist's session with the patient, how does the skills 
trainer apply the consultation approach? 
The most important factor here is the skills trainer's attitude toward the 
individual therapist. At the meeting, it would be appropriate to share with 
the team what is being covered in skUls training. The skills trainer could even 
share the work with the individual patient and her homework assignment 
(although this might be a bit marginal). The trainer might also share his or 
--- Page 433 ---
414 BASIC TREATMENT STRATEGIES 
her hopes that the patient will be reinforced if she uses new skills. But the 
key is in the attitude that no matter what happens, the skills trainer will as­
sist the patient in coping with the situation. The individual therapist's job 
in this instance is to represent society. The skills trainer's job is to teach the 
patient to cope with society. If she asks skUlftiUy and gets reinforced, she leams 
that skUled behavior is more useful than demanding and aggressive behavior 
If she does not get reinforced, she has a chance to learn that even perfect be­
havior is not always reinforced in the everyday world. Which is the more im­
portant lesson? It is not clear, since both are crucial. 
Let us say that the patient comes to the next skills training session and 
says that before she even completed her request, the individual therapist cut 
her off, said no abruptly, and refused to negotiate. The skills trainer's task 
now is to help the patient analyze her own behavior and the other person's 
as objeaively as possible, and figure out how to cope with this turn of events. 
At the next team meeting, how does the trainer apply the consultation ap­
proach? The role of information exchange in this instance is to get the in­
dividual therapist's perspective — not in order to decide who is right, but in 
order to help the patient fine-tune her strategy. The objeaive is for the skills 
trainer to obtain the information he or she might have obtained from aaual­
ly attending the individual session. It is an approximation of having a camera 
trained on the interaction, except (and this is very important) that instead 
of a camera the skills trainer has the prism of the individual therapist. DBT 
does not assume that patients distort and therapists do not. 
In the next interaction with the patient, the skiUs trainer might share 
the information he or she has obtained about how the patient came across 
to the therapist or how the therapist saw it. Perhaps both saw the interaction 
similarly. Or maybe the therapist was having an "off day, or perhaps the 
patient failed to realize that she made her request in the middle of discussing 
another important topic from which the therapist did not want to digress. 
Or perhaps the therapist felt that the patient once again presented her re­
quest in a very unskilled, demanding manner Whatever the case, the skills 
trainer now has both sides of the story and can use that information (or not) 
in trying to help the patient improve her interactional style. 
This rule can be particularly difficult, of course, when a therapist be­
lieves that another person's treatment of the patient is detrimental. But the 
belief in the patient in DBT is so strong that it dictates holding one's com­
ments to another professional and assuming that the patient will be success­
ful in modifying or stopping the detrimental tteatment. For example, if another 
professional is inadvertently reinforcing maladaptive behaviors (a not infre­
quent occurrence), the DBT therapist teaches the patient to work with the 
other professional in making appropriate changes. Leaming to be an informed 
and skillful consumer in the medical system is an important DBT goal. Be­
cause of its importance, this topic is discussed again below. 
Corollary 5: Teach the patient to act as her own agent in obtaining ap­
propriate care. An important role of the DBT therapist is to teach the patient 
how to obtain whatever professional care she may need. Thus, a therapist 
--- Page 434 ---
Case Management Strategies 415 
must teach the patient to evaluate her own needs, survey the available 
resources, contact those resources and ask for services, and evaluate the serv­
ices she receives. For example, when a patient is admitted to an inpatient set­
ting, it is her responsibility both to get a pass to come to individual and skills 
training sessions, and to keep enough control over her medication that she 
is not placed on medications she knows won't help (or are not allowed in 
her treatment program). The therapist should not call the inpatient staff (un­
less absolutely necessary, as described above), but should teach the patient 
how to be effective in that environment. The patient herself (perhaps with 
firm guidance from the DBT therapist) must work with the outpatient phar­
macotherapist to limit undue access to potentially lethal drugs (see Chapter 
15 for further discussion). 
This principle appears deceptively simple. In praaice, many of our 
cherished ways of treating patients must be rethought. Take the patient on 
an inpatient unit who cuts herself deeply. In DBT, the therapist or staff mem­
ber does not call and arrange for a medical consultation (unless, of course, 
the patient is clearly unable to do so). Instead, the patient is instruaed to 
call and make the appointment. The staff coaches; the patient calls. Ther­
apists and staff members do not make appointments for patients with other 
professionals. It is assumed that adults are capable of making their own ap­
pointments. A therapist intervenes only when a patient is clearly unable to 
do so and the failure to make a timely appointment would lead to conse­
quences more seriously negative than the positive learning the patient is en­
gaged in. 
Corollary 6: Do not intervene, solve problems, or act for the patient with 
other professionals. This corollary is the flip side of Corollary 5. If the pa­
tient serves as her own agent in resolving difficulties with other persons, in­
cluding other medical and mental health professionals, then it stands to reason 
that the therapist should not intervene for her If the patient is dissatisfied 
with an anciUary treatment she is receiving, or with another therapist, the 
therapist working with her at the moment helps her figure out how to com­
municate this effeaively to the other professional. The therapist treats the 
patient as ultimately capable (with more or less skills training) of acting in 
her own behalf. For example, if a patient is having difficulties with one or 
more members of the treatment team, the therapist who knows about it does 
not go to the others and explain or try to solve the problem. Therapists do 
not serve as stand-ins for patients. For instance, "She is really angry at you, 
but is afraid to tell you. How could you have done that to her?" is not an 
acceptable communication. One can immediately see why this is easy in con­
cept and difficuh in practice. Humility is a requisite if this approach is not 
to go astray. 
Corollary 7: Do not defend other professionals. Within the therapy team, 
consultation to the patient requires that each therapist accept responsibility 
only for his or her own behavior, and not for that of others. Thus, it is not 
the job of one therapist to defend another therapist to the patient. As in the 
real world, some people may interaa with the patient better than others. All 
--- Page 435 ---
416 BASIC TREATMENT STRATEGIES 
therapists make mistakes. Rules may change, depending on who is enforcing 
them. An assumption in DBT is that "bad" things patients think therapists do, 
they probably do. As noted earlier, the therapist does not intervene for the 
patient with other treatment professionals. The point here is that the ther­
apist also does not intervene for other treatment professionals with the pa­
tient. That is, the therapist does not stand in for his or her professional 
colleagues. 
The rule does not mean that one therapist cannot help the patient un­
derstand another better. Indeed, teaching the patient how to be effeaive with 
others often includes helping them develop an empathetic and understand­
ing attitude. It also does not mean that one therapist cannot agree with 
another, even if the patient is furious at the other. For example, we had a 
patient in our clinic who had enormous difficulties with her skills training 
therapist, who in fact did make significant therapeutic mistakes. Once the 
mistakes were made, however, there seemed no way to repair the relation­
ship. The patient not only became extremely abusive, but continued the abuse 
well after the end of skills training. The skills trainer finally cut off all con­
tact. The patient then began calling me (as clinic director), imploring me to 
"make" her former skills trainer talk to her My response was to validate the 
patient's distress, validate the trainer's right to observe her own limits, and 
assist the patient in problem-solving how she was going to handle this pain­
ful state of affairs. 
Instances When Other Treatment Is Undermining Therapy 
With the exceptions noted above under environmental intervention, the DBT 
therapist does not intervene with other professionals and try to get them to 
change ineffective or iatrogenic treatments or ones that don't fit with DBT. 
Instead, the response is to analyze the ancillary treatment situation with the 
patient and then set about teaching the patient how to intervene in her own 
treatment community. The first option should be to try to help the patient 
influence other professionals to change their treatment approach to her If 
this fails, the option of terminating or changing to another professional or 
treatment program should be explored. Several examples may illustrate the 
point. 
One patient in my clinic goes to emergency rooms whenever there is a 
crisis (which is often). Since she is usually threatening suicide, she almost al­
ways gets admitted. According to her, these admissions are against her wishes, 
although she admits that going into hospitals is a method of avoiding her 
problems. (Also, the food is very good.) Not only is the patient being rein­
forced for passive and suicidal behavior, but the frequent hospitalizations are 
so disruptive that she has lost three jobs and is now on public assistance. Her 
morale is decreasing further (along with ours), and therapy is going down­
hill. Can't I consult with the hospitals about developing new, more effective 
ways to handle her? No. Why not? Because even if I do get one hospital to 
adopt a more effeaive policy, in Seattle there are at least 10 reasonably good 
--- Page 436 ---
Case Management Strategies 417 
inpatient psychiatric units. If I "shape up" one, the patient may go to another 
By the time I consult with all the hospitals, the patient may go back to the 
first, which will in all likelihood have a completely new staff; I will then have 
to go and consult there again. And what if the patient moves? Shall I follow 
her from city to city? No. It seems that it will be much easier if I just "shape 
up" the patient to manage ineffective hospital responses. The patient must 
learn how to consult with the hospital staff and how to refuse unnecessary 
hospital admissions. She and the hospital together need to work out a treat­
ment plan—perhaps one in which she can go and talk to someone in an emer­
gency, but cannot be reinforced for passive and suicidal behavior 
The consultation approach is also very effeaive at decreasing a therapist's 
own anger at other professionals, and at keeping attention and energy fo­
cused on helping the patient. I had an epileptic patient who was a long-time 
patient of a specialist in town. At times, the blood levels of her anticonvuls­
ants would get too high or too low, and she would go to the emergency room. 
She was often admitted to a medical floor Invariably the staff would start 
changing her medications from one to another, ignoring her statements that 
she did not do well on the new medication and her requests that they consult 
with her specialist. After discharge, it could take up to 3 weeks to get her 
back on her usual medications and stabilized again. It happened once more: 
She was admitted to a medical floor, and whUe talking to me on the phone 
told me that the staff was again changing her medications. My immediate 
emotional response was anger at the attending physician, primarily because 
I felt I was the one who had to "pick up the pieces" every time this happened. 
My first temptation was to call the attending physician and intervene. I was 
tired and impatient and wanted to stop the cycle. Calling, however, would 
have been a violation of the consultation approach. I soon realized that my 
task was not to change the people treating my patient (a task that felt over­
whelming), but to change the patient (a task that felt much more manage­
able). My anger dropped to nothing. I called the patient back and told her 
(in a rather firm tone) that this time she simply had to refuse to let them change 
her medications without proper consultation. She was more of an expert on 
her own body at this point than they were. Although the consultation-to-the-
patient approach took some time, it finally worked. The patient is now quite 
good at seeing that her medications are monitored correctiy The alert reader 
has probably noticed here that effective self-care for this patient meant that 
she needed to get one health professional to consult with another health profes­
sional. That is, she was trying to get her specialist to intervene with the at­
tending physician —a good strategy. 
What does the therapist do when it is a member of the DBT treatment 
team who is providing the nontherapeutic or destructive therapy? It is here 
that the therapist walks a delicate tightrope between the consultation-to-the-
patient approach (not standing in for the patient or telling others how to treat 
the patient) and the therapist supervision/consultation approach (carrying out 
treatment planning and treatment modification as a group). The consultation-
to-the-patient approach is biased toward exchanging with other therapists in-
--- Page 437 ---
418 BASIC TREATMENT STRATEGIES 
formation about one's own treatment plan and goals, and the effeas on the 
patient and your treatment goals of the other team members' treatment. The 
therapist supervision/consultation approach is biased toward searching for 
a synthesis between two or more treatment approaches. 
Handling Crisis Calls 
Calls from Professionals Outside the Treatment Team. Most health 
professionals are used to coordinating treatment for specific patients without 
the active involvement (although, of course, with the consent) of the patient. 
Crisis intervention teams, police and rescue squads, housing supervisors, 
residential counselors and case managers, and emergency room personnel 
sometimes take great pains to call an individual's psychotherapist to obtain 
guidance on how best to respond to the patient during a crisis. No matter 
what the situation, the DBT policy is the same: When professionals who are 
not members of the treatment team call, the therapist should (1) obtain as 
much information about the situation as they will give; (2) provide the callers 
with necessary information the patient cannot give, and verify (or correct) 
information the patient has given; (3) tell them to follow their normal proce­
dures; and (4) ask to talk to the patient. The therapist then coaches the pa­
tient in how to best cope with the situation and interaa with the professionals. 
(Again, the consultation approach is not applied if the patient is unable to 
cooperate and the outcome is important. For example, if the patient is un­
conscious or groggy, or too hostile to talk, the therapist gives necessary in­
formation about history, treatment, and medications.) 
For example, my therapy unit sometimes uses space in a larger psychiatry 
clinic. One of our patients was constantly distracting the clinic staff mem­
bers by engaging them in conversations they felt unable to break off and by 
occasionally acting in an overtly hostile manner in the waiting room, creat­
ing difficulties for other patients. The clinic director responded by sending 
me a series of notes complaining about "my" patient, indirectly suggesting 
that I should control the patient better The clinic was not set up for this type 
of patient, and other patients were being harmed. I was more interested in 
keeping the patient alive, since suicide was a major risk at the time. Further­
more, I knew that the patient's behavior in the clinic was a considerable im­
provement over her previous behaviors in other clinics. The clinic responded 
to the patient by developing a series of (what seemed to me) repressive rules 
about permissible patient behavior I responded by firing off my own series 
of complaining letters to the clinic director Both of our tempers flared, and 
staff splitting emerged. Where was the mistake? The mistake was in my 
responding to the clinic director with anything other than "Follow your usual 
procedures and I will help the patient cope." I had protected the patient's fra-
gUity instead of strengthening her potential capability. Although a problem-
solving meeting with the clinic director might have been useful, such a meet­
ing should have been held with the patient present. 
--- Page 438 ---
Case Management Strategies 419 
Calls from Members of the Treatment Team. Within the therapy team, 
the individual or primary therapist ordinarily handles crisis situations. Thus, 
all DBT collateral therapists should call the primary therapist for instructions 
on how to handle the patient if a crisis arises (unless clear procedures have 
already been worked out). In this instance, the primary therapist does not 
say, "Follow your usual procedures." Instead, the primary therapist gives in­
struaions. Chapter 15 discusses this in greater detail. 
Attending Case Conferences 
The consultation-to-the-patient approach in no way proscribes coodinating 
treatment and attending case conferences about the patient. Treatment coor­
dination with non-DBT ancillary therapists can sometimes be very useful, 
especially with therapists who wUl maintain a reasonably long-term relation­
ship with the patient, such as case managers, inpatient attending physicians, 
or pharmacotherapists. It can also be extremely useful when therapy is "stuck," 
or when the patient is in crisis and is either on an inpatient unit or is going 
from therapist to therapist. The ideal situation is one in which the patient 
arranges for the case conference. 
During the case conference, the therapist's primary tasks are to help the 
patient speak for herself and to share and obtain information. (This is usual­
ly not possible until after the therapist has oriented the network, however) 
The therapist concentrates on helping the patient interact skillfully; unless 
absolutely necessary, he or she does not speak for the patient. The therapist 
is there as a coach, not a substitute player. The therapist does speak for him­
self or herself in explaining the treatment principles and plan, clarifying his 
or her own limits, and so on. The therapist at times must actively work to 
keep the patient collaboratively involved in the treatment discussion and plan­
ning. A patient's active passivity, and the traditional practices of many men­
tal health professionals, can conspire to create an atmosphere where the patient 
can be present in body but left out in spirit. 
3. CONSULTATION TO THE PATIENT 
ABOUT HOW TO HANDLE FAMILY AND FRIENDS 
FamUy and friends can be important alHes in treating borderline patients. Their 
support for the patient's staying in therapy is important. In my experience, 
invalidating families and friends often believe that people should be able to 
handle their problems, no matter how severe, without going to a therapist. 
In particular, parents are sometimes adamantiy opposed to their children's 
participating in a treatment program. The acceptance of psychotherapy is quite 
different wfthin different cultural and class backgrounds. Other families and 
friends may wish to be activelly involved in the treatment process. The ther­
apist's primary role in each of these instances is to help the patient communi­
cate effectively with her social network about her problems, her treatment. 
--- Page 439 ---
420 BASIC TREATMENT STRATEGIES 
and her needs; to evaluate conflicting advice about treatment and problem 
solutions; and to make decisions for herself skillfully. 
Calls from Family and Friends 
An encounter that is often difficult for a therapist is a call of distress from 
family and friends (e.g., roommates) of the patient. Often they want advice 
from the therapist about what to do or how to handle general or specific 
problems with the patient. Sometimes they want a progress report on thera­
py or reassurance about the therapist's credentials. (This is especially likely 
when the person is a parent and/or is paying for the therapy.) Or they may 
be calling because of fears that the patient is going to commit suicide. The 
general principle here is that the therapist can get information (especially if 
the call is about suicide risk), can give information about himself or herself 
(e.g., credentials or experience), and can provide general information about 
DBT and BPD. However, the therapist does not give information about the 
patient or about therapy with the patient. The therapist can help caUers cope 
with their own problems and feelings, but does not help them cope with the 
patient when the patient is not a party to the interaaion. 
Calls from family and friends must be handled with the utmost sensitiv­
ity. A cavalier or insensitive brushoff of family and friends by the therapist 
can harm rather than help a patient in her efforts to stay in therapy. General­
ly, it is best to make the point at the very beginning of each conversation that 
the therapist cannot share information about the patient. The therapist must 
make it clear that the refusal to share reflects on the nature of psychotherapy, 
not on characteristics of the caller 
Although the therapist may listen to the caller's difficulties, consultations 
with a patient's networks always include the patient. Thus, without the pa­
tient present the therapist can advise the caller how to get the consultation 
he or she needs, but not about how to help the patient. At times, the ther­
apist may empathize with and reflect the emotional distress the family mem­
ber or friend is communicating. The idea is to focus the conversation on the 
caller and on the therapist, not on the patient or on therapy. 
The patient should be informed about the call, and the content of the 
conversation should be disclosed and discussed. The therapist's plan to do 
so, should have been disclosed to the caller 
Conducting Family Sessions 
As noted earlier in this chapter, DBT has not been used in treating patients 
younger than 15. For an adolescent (especially an emancipated teenager), the 
patient's family is treated consistently with the consultation approach. If the 
therapist thinks that communication with the family might be helpful at times, 
it is advanced like any other solution to a problem- as something the patient 
must choose and implement. Family therapy sessions, however, are not in-
--- Page 440 ---
Case Management Strategies 421 
consistent with DBT and may at times be prescribed (see Chapter 15). Ses­
sions with family members without the patient present, however, are incon­
sistent with DBT. This means that although the therapist helps the patient 
understand the reactions of significant others, the therapist's contract is al­
ways with the patient, not with the others. During a meeting with family mem­
bers or significant others, the therapist also helps the participants adopt a 
better understanding of and more validating attitude toward the patient. The 
DBT theory is advanced, and the need for validation and skill building is dis­
cussed. 
Arguments Against the Consultation Approach 
The consultation-to-the-patient approach in DBT is quite different from, and 
sometimes diametrically opposite to, the behaviors expected of mental health 
professionals. Furthermore, it is undeniably time-consuming. It also appears 
inconsistent, at least at face value, with a systems (including a dialectical sys­
tems) approach. These arguments are discussed below, together with my coun­
terarguments for maintaining the consultation approach. 
Mores of Psychotherapy 
Psychotherapists are expected to exchange information routinely with their 
colleagues about patients' history, diagnoses, medications, treatment response, 
current status, and any other information that would help the professionals 
currently treating the patients. Even when patients are capable of speaking 
up for themselves and intervening on their own behalf, however, therapists 
are ordinarily still expected to provide information and consult with other 
health professionals trearing the patients. Therapeutic mores are lightly dis­
regarded in DBT. The divergence between DBT and usual practices is based 
on two lines of argument, one clinical and one empirical. 
Clinical Argument. The mores of coUegial behavior in psychotherapy 
are based on the model of medical treatment. Case consultation and provi­
sion of referral information are necessary in medicine because the average 
patient seeing a physician is not competent to convey complex medical infor­
mation accurately to a new physician. When a patient with a history of heart 
ailments is taken to the emergency room, it may be of life-and-death impor­
tance that the physician know the individual's medical history and current 
medications. 
The problem arises in transferting the mles of medical treatment for phys­
ical disorders to psychosocial treatment for behavioral disorders. Although 
patients may not be able to give a coherent review of their heart or liver func­
tioning, most individuals, including borderline patients in psychotherapy, can 
give a quite coherent account of their behavioral functioning. To the extent 
that psychotherapy is coUaborative, one would also expea psychotherapy pa-
--- Page 441 ---
422 BASIC TREATMENT STRATEGIES 
tients to be able to give a reasonable account of their current treatment plan, 
although patients are rarely experts here. When the goal is enhancing an in­
dividual's abilities to control her own behavior and influence her own desti­
ny, however, the situation is different: Either the patient is the best expert 
on her own behavior or she should be. The consultation-to-the-patient ap­
proach is designed to make sure that if the individual is not the expert on 
herself now, she becomes the expert. 
Of course, at times a patient cannot give such an account and may even 
purposely distort information to obtain the treatment she wants. And, as noted 
above, when the immediate outcome is very important and the patient is un­
able or unwilling to intervene effeaively for herself, the therapist should move 
from the consultation strategies to the environmental intervention strategies. 
In my clinical experience, however, many therapists and treatment settings 
underestimate the capabUities of patients and overestimate borderline individu­
als' tendency to distort and manipulate communications to meet their own 
wishes. Too often, too much is done for a patient. The borderline individual 
is often treated as more fragile or more manipulative than she is. A therapist 
intervenes when the patient can and should intervene effeaively for herself. 
A consistent comment from the borderline patients in our program is that 
a very therapeutic part of the treatment is our belief in the patients' capabUi­
ties when others (including the patient) frequently do not believe. We trust 
them when many accuse them. 
Empirical Argument. The strongest argument for adopting the consul­
tation-to-the-patient strategies recommended in DBT is the empirical evidence 
that the DBT model of treatment, including this group of strategies, is an 
effective one. Although the consultation strategies may have been irrelevant 
to the treatment outcome, it is not inconsequential that the treatment as a 
whole has been found to be effeaive. At the moment, I know of no empirical 
data indicating that the strategies are detrimental or ineffective. 
Time Demands on Health Professionals 
The consultation approach can be quite time-consuming. Often it is easier 
to do something for another person than it is to walk her step by step through 
doing it for herself. A useful analogy is to compare the therapist to a parent 
in a hurry in the grocery store with a child just learning to walk: It is often 
easier to pick the chUd up and carry her than to wait for her every tentative 
step. Teaching sometimes requires infinite patience. Taking care of is often 
easier than taking care/on Although the DBT bias is toward taking the time 
necessary, at times the therapist has to be practical and pick the person up. 
For example, a patient may go to an emergency room, threaten suicide, 
and say that she needs immediate hospitalization. Knowing that the patient 
has been repeatedly hospitalized under similar circumstances in the past 
without benefit can be important in deciding whether to hospitalize her now. 
--- Page 442 ---
Case Management Strategies 423 
Taking an extensive history may be difficult in the emergency room setting; 
certainly, it is easier and quicker if the patient or the therapist can give such 
information. If the patient is desperate for hospitalization, she may not diviUge 
accurate information about her past. Thus, the expedient thing to do is to 
call the patient's current therapist and ask both for information and for treat­
ment recommendations. The expeaation is that the therapist wiU provide such 
information. In DBT, the therapist does not provide such information in ev­
ery case, but the therapist does not refuse every time either To do so might 
alienate the very professional the patient needs on her side. The usual policy 
in such an instance is to review the situation with the patient, making it clear 
that the other professional does not have the time to evaluate her specific case, 
and then, with the patient's permission, to give the information necessary 
for the new professional to proceed. The therapist, however, does not gener­
ally tell the emergency room physician whether to hospitalize the patient or 
not, although the therapist may give information about his or her policies 
on hospitalization in general or in particular with this patient. 
What about the System? 
When an individual lives in an unsafe environment, how should a therapist 
tai^et treatment? Should it focus on making the environment safer? Should 
the individual be taken out of the unsafe environment if it cannot be changed? 
Or should treatment focus on teaching the individual how to keep safe in 
an unsafe environment? Each approach has its merits; each is necessary at 
times. Within DBT, however, the philosophical emphasis is on the last of 
these—teaching the patient how to create safety for herself. As in feminist 
therapy, the focus is on "empowering" the individual. 
Within DBT, the role of the therapist is to show the patient how to change 
the system (including the DBT system). The intervention approach is "bottom-
up" rather than "top-down." When this is not possible—for example, the sys­
tem is extraordinarily abusive, or unwilling or unable to change—the patient 
is helped out of the system. Although the therapist may try to change profes­
sional or other systems, these efforts are done on behalf of all patients, not 
a particular patient. Patients' aspirations to get themselves and their own lives 
under reasonable control, and then to work toward improving the system, 
are encouraged. 
THERAPIST SUPERVISION/CONSULTATION STRATEGIES 
Supervision/consultation with therapists is integral, rather than ancUlary, to 
DBT. Consultation to the therapist, as a group of treatment strategies, balances 
the consuhation-to-the-patient strageties discussed above. DBT, from this per-
specitive, is defined as a treatment system in which (1) therapists apply DBT 
to the patients and (2) the supervisor and/or consultation team applies DBT

to the therapists. The supervisor and/or consultation team provides a dialec­
tical balance for therapists in their interactions with patients. 
There are three primary funaions of consultation to the therapist in DBT. 
First, the supervisor or consultation team helps to keep each individual ther­
apist in the therapeutic relationship. The role here is to cheerlead and sup­
port the therapist. Second, the supervisor or consultation team balances the 
therapist in his or her interaaions with the patient (see Figure 13.1). In provid­
ing balance, consultants may move close to the therapist, helping him or her 
maintain a strong position. Or consultants may move back from the ther­
apist, requiring the therapist to move closer to the patient to maintain balance. 
Third, within the programmatic applications of DBT, the supervision/con­
sultation team provides the context for the treatment. At its purest, DBT is 
a transactional relationship between and among a community of borderline 
patients and a community of mental health professionals. 
The Need for Supervision/Consultation 
As I have noted previously, DBT was developed and first applied within a 
clinical research context. Extensive therapist training, close supervision of in­
dividual cases, and consultation among all therapists about applications of 
the treatment to emerging clinical problems are integral components of any 
clinical research program. Supervision and consultation, however, were origi­
nally viewed as ancillary to the treatment process itself. I believed that such 
extensive supervision/consultation would be unnecessary outside of a research 
context and/or once training of new therapists was completed. Feedback from 
therapists over the course of the research program and from patients with 
histories of therapy gone awry, however, persuaded me gradually that the role 
of supervision and consultation in nonresearch therapy applications is perhaps 
more important than I had first imagined. 
I have come to believe that it is extraordinarily difficult to deliver effec­
tive treatment to most borderline patients without consultation or supervi­
sion. I have been amazed at how many very good therapists end up conduaing 
ineffective therapy or making major mistakes with this patient population. 
In clinical settings, such as inpatient units and agencies, therapists at times 
seem to act almost as borderline as their patients. They are often extreme 
in their positions; invalidate one another and their patients; blame the pa­
tients as much as the patients blame themselves; are vulnerable to criticism 
or feedback from others about their manner of treatment; have chaotic rela-
--- Page 444 ---
Case Management Strategies 425 
tionships with one another, often marked by "staff splitting"; and vacillate 
among feeling alone, discouraged, hopeless, and depressed, feeling angry and 
hostile at the patients or other staff members, and feeling energetic, confi­
dent, encouraged, and hopeful. Although it is not difficult to understand why 
these pattems emerge, therapists often put unrealistic demands on themselves 
to be better in the absence of a context or community that supports change. 
Why do these patterns develop? There are a number of reasons. 
First, the patients as a whole engage in the three most stressful patient 
behaviors (suicide attempts, suicide threats, and hostility) (Hellman, Morri­
son, & Abramowitz, 1986). They also communicate their intense suffering 
at every turn, adding to therapists' stress. Added to this, progress in therapy 
is much slower than with most patients, even when the most effective treat­
ments are instituted. In sum, patients beg their therapist to help them im­
mediately and threaten suicide if they fail. This would not be so stressful if 
the patient could be helped immediately, but they usually cannot. Therapists 
end up feeling incompetent, ineffective, and helpless in a situation where they 
very much care and want to succeed. The resulting tendencies are to "blame 
the victims," switch treatments impulsively, and/or engage in palliative ac­
tivities that help the patients feel better now but harm their long-term prog­
nosis. If all these fail, therapists often subtly push the patients out of therapy 
(perhaps by saying that the patients are not ready for therapy now) or precipi­
tously terminate them. 
Second, patients often inadvertently reinforce therapists for engaging in 
ineffective therapy and punish them for engaging in effective therapy. At least 
this is often the case when therapists are trying to implement DBT. In individu­
al therapy, a patient usually does not want to discuss targeted behaviors, such 
as parasuicide, therapy-interfering behaviors of her own, or behavioral pat­
tems seriously interfering with her life. If she does so, she wants to have a 
heart-to-heart discussion about her feelings or the therapist's behavior, rather 
than analyzing her behavior or engaging in more adaptive problem solving. 
The power struggle that ensues is usually very aversive to the therapist. It is 
much easier to let the patient control the agenda; frequently, it is also a lot 
more interesting. In skills training, patients want to discuss their current crises 
instead of concentrating on learning skills. When they are willing to focus 
on skills training, they criticize the skUls for not being helpful enough. The 
skiUs trainer may begin to wonder, "Why bother?" If the trainer gets angry 
enough, it is easy to go overboard on the skills training struaure, completely 
ignoring important process issues. If the trainer gets frustrated enough, it is 
easy just to drop skiUs training and "go with the flow," so to speak. 
Third, patients present not only as needy but as very capable of nurtur­
ing the therapists. Patients often believe that being friends to the therapists 
is in their owm therapeutic best interest; thus, it is easy for therapits to veer 
into discussing themselves and their own problems. This can then lead into 
a reversal of roles, where the patients become the therapists to the therapists. 
In my clinic, I have consulted on cases where patients have loaned therapists 
--- Page 445 ---
426 BASIC TREATMENT STRATEGIES 
money for house mortgages, gone to therapists' homes to care for them when 
they are sick, accepted crisis calls from therapists who are getting divorces, 
and provided housekeeping and secretarial services for therapists. With bor­
derline patients, it can be very easy for therapists to delude themselves into 
thinking that sexual contaa and aaivity are somehow therapeutic for the pa­
tients. 
The therapist consultation/supervision strategies are described below and 
are outlined in Table 13.3. 
I. MEETING TO CONFER ON TREATMENT 
Modes of Supervision/Consultation 
How the therapist engages in supervision/consultation and who the commu­
nity is depend almost completely on his or her work setting and borderline 
patient load. Therapists in private praaice may contract for formal supervi­
sion with a more experienced therapist, may arrange with a coUeague for peer 
supervision, or may attend peer consultation group. Such arrangements are 
usually not difficult in urban settings, but may require ingenuity (e.g., con­
ference phone consultation) in rural settings. In agency, day treatment, and 
inpatient settings, the DBT supervision/consultation meeting may be the regu­
lar weekly team meeeting or case conference, or there may be a special DBT 
consultation meeting. 
The frequency and length of meetings depend on the number of ther­
apists attending and the number of patients to be discussed. Meetings in my 
research clinic usually take place every week and last for 2 hours. When I 
have provided individual consultation for private praaitioners, meetings have 
usually been 1-hour biweekly sessions. I myself usually discuss my own pa­
tients with a consultant or team at least twice a month. Although the mini­
mum number of people required for a meeting is two, a dialeaical approach 
is much easier to adhere to when there are three or more. Once a polarity 
develops, a third person can be very helpful in spotting the dialeaic and en­
couraging a synthesis. 
Meeting Agenda 
In individual consultation, the agenda is, of course, set by the therapist seek­
ing consultation. In peer consultation meetings and team meetings, or case 
conferences in instimtional or programmatic settings, various formats for meet­
ings are possible. The important items on the agenda are as foUows: 
1. Each therapist should have an opportunity to bring up any problems 
he or she is having with a particular patient. Problems might include deter­
mining which patient behaviors to focus treatment on at the moment; select­
ing or implementing treatment strategies; responding to problematic patient 
behaviors; or coping with the therapist's own feelings or attitudes toward the

patient or toward therapy. Each therapist should review at least one case (even 
if only briefly) at each meeting, and should give a brief progress report on 
all patients. The role of the team or consultant here is to help the therapist 
think clearly about how to conceptualize the patient, the relationship, and 
change in DBT theoretical terms, and how to apply the treatment skillfully. 
2. Skills trainers should have an opportunity both to tell the individual 
--- Page 447 ---
428 BASIC TREATMENT STRATEGIES 
therapists what skills are being taught at the moment and to highlight any 
problems individual patients are having in skills training. Individual therapists 
can provide information about patients' difficulties with skills and about 
specific areas of competence or incompetence. This is a chance for the in­
dividual and skills training therapists to exchange information about patients 
and discuss their respective treatment plans. Similar principles apply to the 
interactions with other modes of therapy (e.g., vocational rehabilitation, case 
management) that may be part of the DBT program. Because DBT does not 
require consistency, agreement among team members is not actuaUy neces­
sary here. However, the dialectical agreement argues for attempting to arrive 
at a synthesis if opposing positions are voiced. The entire team helps a skUls 
trainer and an individual therapist in a particular case, or a case manager 
and individuall therapist in another, to do this. 
3. In agency or clinic settings, or when therapy is part of a DBT pro­
gram, institutional decisions that must be made are discussed. The goal is 
to reach a synthesis on how institutional problems should be responded to 
(although, once again, agreement is not strictly necessary). An example here 
is the patient who goes to skills training and kicks holes in the walls or acts 
in a way that disrupts other therapy sessions. What are the institutional limits? 
What is the clinic or unit director willing to put up with? Who should ob­
serve the limits? Who should communicate limits and consequences to the 
patient? Ordinarily, the patient's individual therapist will be responsible for 
day-to-day management of the case, including communication of any institu­
tional limits. However, coordination (insofar as coordination is feasible or 
possible) is conducted at the DBT meeting. It is not at all unusual that pa­
tients will go directly to other members of the treatment team, including the 
unit director These interactions are shared. 
4. All therapists should have a chance to bring up any misunderstand­
ings or problems they are having in implementing DBT. In this situation, the 
elements of DBT are like the U.S. Constitution, and the group as a whole 
operates like the Supreme Court. They try to figure out how to implement 
the elements in the specific case. 
5. For therapists and other program staff members who are leaming DBT, 
it is quite helpful if a segment of the meeting is set aside to review the DBT 
principles of treatment more generally. In my team meetings, during the first 
half hour of each meeting I review some aspect of DBT. This can be very 
important in developing a unit or team DBT culture. The task of developing 
and maintaining a shared treatment philosophy and approach to case con­
ceptualization should not be put off or its importance minimized. 
KEEPING SUPERVISION/CONSULTATION AGREEMENTS 
Tbe therapist supervision/consultation agreements have been discussed in 
Chapter 4 and are summarized in Table 13.3. The importance of these agree­
ments cannot be overemphasized. They form the fundamental contract upon 
--- Page 448 ---
Case Management Strategies 429 
which meetings are based. The vulnerability and nondefensiveness that are 
requisite characteristics of those attending these meetings are simply not pos­
sible if there is no common basis of understanding. 
In some institutional settings, this prescription may create a dilemma. 
Diverse theoretical orientations, treatment philosophies, time constraints, and 
institutional lethargy can interfere with a staffs wiUingness to agree upon 
and implement DBT supervision/consultation strategies. For example, on some 
inpatient units individual psychotherapists apply treatments based on other 
theoretical approaches, do not attend staff meetings, and are not part of the 
inpatient milieu. (Of course, when this is the case DBT is only being im­
plemented partially, since the core of the treatment is the individual psy­
chotherapy.) Or a borderline treatment program may be a subunit in a larger 
clinic that houses diverse treatment programs of many different orientations. 
When a small number of DBT therapists work within a larger institutional 
setting, the DBT-oriented staff should meet together, coordinate their treat­
ments, and follow supervision/consultation agreements. Those applying other 
treatment programs —for example, the individual psychotherapists on inpa­
tient units mentioned above —are viewed as ancillary (to DBT) treatment 
professionals. In some settings, the entire staff simply is not going to agree 
to trying DBT. Here, a synthesis must be searched for between the polarities 
of those implementing DBT and those not. The DBT therapists, at least, must 
attend to the DBT agreements. Polarizing between DBT and non-DBT is 
anti-DBT. 
3. CHEERLEADING 
It is all too easy to become demoralized when treating borderline patients. 
Sources of demoralization are numerous. It can at times be exceptionally 
difficult to see that a patient is making any progress. Sometimes a therapist 
is too close to the trees to see the forest. The role of supervisors and team 
members is to find and magnify that little bit of change or progress that the 
patient did in fact make. Reminding the therapist of the usual slow progress 
of borderiine individuals and of other similar patients who were just as recal­
citrant, but nonetheless proved successful, is also part of the consultants' task. 
These continuing reminders can sometimes be needed for quite some time. 
I once had a patient with whom I felt like a failure every week. Every week 
I went to the consultation meeting saying that we should refer her or send 
her back to the hospital; obviously I could not help her And every week the 
skills training leader pointed out some very minor but nonetheless positive 
move the patient had made. Renewed and invigorated, I went back into the 
hattie with energy. After a year of cumulative progress, even I could see it 
clearly, and demoralization became less of a problem for me. 
Because of the extremely difficult environments within which they usually 
live, borderline patients often feel hopeless and helpless to change their situ­
ation, and therapists can easily fall into despair with them. A particular 
--- Page 449 ---
430 BASIC TREATMENT STRATEGIES 
difficulty in our clinic is many patients' lack of financial resources. For ex­
ample, patients lose the medical benefits of public assistance if they get em­
ployment. Recurrent medical problems then force them to quit their jobs in 
order to get medical care. Back on public assistance, they not only feel like 
failures, but must live on such low benefits that they may not be able to con­
tinue paying for therapy. If patients have educational aspirations, they may 
be unable to finance their education; very few borderline individuals can han­
dle work and school at the same time. Or they may do better living alone, 
but may be unable to afford it. Many of our patients have difficulty paying 
for transportation to and from therapy, especially because rents are usually 
lower some distance from the city center. Moving to get away from abusive 
famUies or to take advantage of opportunities elsewhere may be impossible. 
The therapists of such patients must not only keep up hope, but must also 
be resourceful in the face of difficulties that would be daunting for even the 
best-adjusted individual. The task of the consultants is to help the therapists 
find the necessary resourcefulness. 
At other times, therapists are in despair with themselves, not with their 
patients. As I have noted many times, therapists tend to make many mistakes 
with borderline patients. The emotional effea of such mistakes can be in­
tense, and therapists can feel terrible. Although it is good to note one's own 
mistakes, feeling excessively bad about them is rarely helpful. UsuaUy, what 
is happening is that such therapists are judging themselves (i.e., not using mind­
fulness skUls) and comparing their own therapeutic behavior with that of 
mythical betters. The role of the consultants here is to use the validation and 
problem-solving strategies to help the therapists respond more reasonably to 
therapy mistakes. Usually, the best consultation strategy will be to make a 
concerted effort to help the therapists come up with a plan for making 
lemonade out of the lemons they have created. Being able to repair mistakes 
in this way can be extremely rewarding. 
4. PROVIDING DIALECTICAL BALANCE 
A fundamental goal of consultation to the therapist is to provide balance for 
each therapist so that he or she can stay within the dialeaical frame of the 
therapy When a patient is rigid, polarized, intense, and in great pain, it can 
be extraordinarily difficult for a therapist to remain flexible. When the pa­
tient attacks her therapist, refuses to cooperate, or goes backward instead of 
forward, it is not unusual for the therapist to move to the opposite extreme-
withdrawing from the patient, wishing to attack back, or wanting to quit. 
It is not unusual on my team for a therapist to walk into a meeting saying, 
"I am ready to kill the patient; give me a DBT way to think!" The team is 
ready for the challenge, validates the therapist's position, and gets to work 
on solving the problem. The team members apply DBT strategies with one 
another 
When a patient is in a seemingly overwhelming crisis, believing herself 
--- Page 450 ---
Case Management Strategies 431 
to be too vulnerable to cope, it is also not unusual for the therapist to go 
to the patient's side of the therapeutic teeter-totter and become overly nur­
turing and solicitous. The therapist comes into the team meeting saying, "I 
am ready to kill every one of you who are being mean to my patient; give 
me a DBT way to think!" The job of the DBT team in this case is to validate 
the reasonableness of the therapist's response and provide a DBT interpreta­
tive counterpoint that will help him or her move to a more balanced posi­
tion. The team uses DBT strategies to treat the therapist. 
It is very important that consultants and supervisors remember the para­
dox of DBT: Change can only occur in the context of acceptance. Thus, an 
important role of consultants is to find the valid responses of the therapist 
and to reflect them within the consultation meeting. It is also the task of con­
sultants to help the therapist make appropriate changes in treatment so that 
the patient is helped most effectively. At times consultants take the side of 
the patient, arguing her case to a recalcitrant and tough-minded therapist. 
At other times they take the long-term view, arguing that tough measures are 
needed. 
A consultation team in a clinic or programmatic setting usually has two 
sources of information about a patient and her treatment. One source is the 
therapist's case review; the other is her interactions with other members of 
the program. On the basis of all the available information, the team applies 
DBT treatment strategies to help each therapist accept himself or herself in 
the moment and also change therapy strategies as needed to be more effec­
tive. To use my colleague Kelly Koerner's phrase, DBT team members are as 
"warmly ruthless" about maintaining fellow therapists within the DBT 
parameters as they are about helping the patients. 
Working Out Problems of "Staff Splitting" 
"Staff splitting," as mentioned earlier, is a much-discussed phenomenon in 
which professionals treating borderline patients begin arguing and fighting 
about a patient, the treatment plan, or the behavior of other professionals 
with the patient. The responsibility for the dissension among the staff is then 
attributed to the patient, who is said to have split the staff; hence the term 
"staff splitting." 
For example, as part of discharge planning, an inpatient was referred 
to my treatment team. A member of our team was halfway through an as­
sessment interview when a staff nurse interrupted, saying that the assessment 
should not continue. We later found that the attending physician did not be­
lieve a behavioral treatment would be appropriate for the patient. Both the 
patient and members of my treatment team got angry. The patient was then 
referred to an outpatient program in the same hospital, with instructions to 
the new unit that the patient should not be permitted to join my program. 
The head of the outpatient unit was now angry at the implication that she 
was not capable of making appropriate treatment plans. At a staff meeting. 
--- Page 451 ---
432 BASIC TREATMENT STRATEGIES 
it was observed that it was clear that the patient was indeed borderline, since 
she had managed to split the staff before she even got to the unit. 
In DBT, arguments among staff members and differences in points of 
view, traditionally associated with staff splitting, are seen as failures in syn­
thesis and interpersonal process among the staff rather than as a patient's 
problem. The staff splits the staff. The belief that a patient does it mns 
perilously close to the type of thinking therapists try to change in their pa­
tients—blaming problems they are having on others or on external events. 
In DBT, staff members are encouraged to use their interpersonal skUls to work 
these problems out as they arise. Therapists' disagreements over a patient are 
treated as potentiaUy equally valid poles of a dialeaic. Thus, the starting point 
for dialogue is the recognization that a polarity has arisen, together with an 
implicit (if not expHcit) assumption that resolution wiU require working toward 
synthesis. 
The precipitants of staff splitting are multiple, and a number of scenarios 
are possible. Much splitting has to do with the faa that therapists' attitudes 
toward patients follow a wave pattern similar to patients' vacillation between 
overidealization and devaluation of therapists. The wave fluauates within a 
space anchored at one extreme by an attitude that the patient needs to try 
harder and the staff should be tougher, and at the other extreme by an attri-
tude that the patient is fragile, the world is too tough on her and the staff 
should be gentler and more nurturing. In one common scenario, two factors 
are present. First, the intensity of the patient's pain communications evoke 
a reciprocal intense desire to care for the patient and cure the pain. The ina­
bility to do this leads to an intense sense of failure or anxiety, especiaUy when 
suicide threats are part of the pain communication. Second, different ther­
apists interaaing with the same patient have attitudes toward the patient that 
are momentarily out of synchrony with each other; the attimdes are at oppo­
site extremes of the wave pattern. Such a state is shown in Figure 13.2 be­
tween staff members A and B. The intensity of the "split" has to do with both 
the intensity of the patient's pain communications and the intensity of the 
therapists' discomfort with that pain. DBT handles this problem by search­
ing for the synthesis between the tough and the gentle positions. In Figure 
13.2, staff member C might be able to help members A and B arrive at a 
synthesis. 
A second scenario has to do with a patient's complaints to one therapist 
(the "good guy") about the terrible behavior of another therapist (the "bad 
guy"). If the "good guy" is on the "patient-as-fragile" apex of the wave, it 
is particularly easy for him or her to get angry at the "bad guy." This tenden­
cy is exacerbated when the stakes are high (e.g., when the patient is suicidal) 
and the "bad guy" is at the "let's-get-tough" apex of the wave. Once again, 
DBT handles this by assuming that there is a synthesis to be found. The su­
pervisor and/or consuhation team searches for both the vahdity of the pa­
tient's complaints and the validity of the accused therapist's behavior 
Defensiveness on the part of the "bad guy," of course, does not help matters.

Dealing with Unethical or Destructive Therapist Behavior 
The therapist supervision/consultation approach is based on the assumption 
that all therapists working on a team meet at least minimum levels of compe­
tence, ethics, and nondefensiveness. The agreements are based on mutual 
respect. It is difficult for a therapist to validate the behavior of another ther­
apist whom he or she does not respect, or to share opinions openly with 
another therapist who is overly sensitive to critical feedback. Occasionally, 
a therapist on the team or in the supervision/consultation group may have 
serious problems that intrude into the treatment, may engage in critical 
breaches of ethics, or may continue with a destruaive treatment relationship. 
Patients may make serious accusations about one therapist to another Gener­
aUy, these problems are first dealt with privately, in individual supervision 
and outside of team meetings. The individual therapist may be confronted 
direaly, or the unit director may be consulted. Serious accusations and ther­
apeutic breaches are not ignored.

434 BASIC TREATMENT STRATEGIES 
Keeping Information Confidential 
With one exception, all consultation discussions are confidential. Informa­
tion about patients is of course confidential, but, just as importantly, infor­
mation therapists reveal about themselves is also confidential. The only 
exception is that patients are apprised of the faa that they are discussed at 
supervision/consultation meetings. When a patient requests it, an individual 
therapist may judiciously reveal some of the substance of the discussion if 
this information will have a positive effea on the patient's relationships with 
other therapists or when the feedback from others might help the patient en­
hance her skills. The potential for distorting the information must be kept 
in mind and freely admitted. 
Concluding Comments 
For some therapists, the case management strategies in DBT are the most 
difficult to implement. The DBT approach goes somewhat against the grain: 
Most of us have been taught principles that are just the opposite of some 
that I am advocating. My colleagues and I evolved these principles and strate­
gies over a number of years of working with these patients in a clinical research 
setting. Some of the principles were first implemented because our research 
required them. For example, we could not easUy use psychiatric inpatient days 
as an outcome measure for outpatient DBT if our treatment team controlled 
how long an individual stayed in the hospital. Caveats and exceptions were 
developed as we went to the limits of a strategy and found where we had to 
allow modification. I was surprised myself to find that many of the treatment 
strategies developed purely for research purposes turned out to be very effec­
tive clinically. Those that worked were kept and now are part of DBT. 
The therapist supervision/consultation approach was at first a research 
necessity, because I had to be sure that all the therapists were aaually con­
duaing the treatment. But when we gave group skiUs training to a lai^e num­
ber of patients receiving individual psychotherapy in the community, I got 
to know firsthand how many therapists were funaioning without the sup­
port of a consultation group. I also consulted with a large number of ther­
apists who contaaed me for help with therapeutic problems; as noted eariier, 
I was surprised by the therapy mistakes that were being made among ther­
apists who seemed otherwise to be very good therapists. As I have consulted 
further to inpatient units and public agencies, I have been struck over and 
over at the lack of supervisory and staff support in many institutional set­
tings. I believe that the failure to obtain and give adequate consultation and 
support is based on a failure to recognize the importance of context and en­
vironmental events in shaping behavior, including therapeutic behavior Ther­
apeutic behavior requires a context that reinforces it. The laws of human 
behavior that apply to our patients apply equally to their therapists.

Structural Strategies 
S "truaural strategies have to do with 
how both DBT as a whole and individual sessions are begun and ended. They 
also have to do with how the therapist structures time during the various 
phases of treatment and during individual sessions. 
The primary task in beginning DBT is to develop a coUaborative treat­
ment contraa. The primary task in ending DBT is to prepare the patient for 
life without DBT and to orient the patient to what she can expea from the 
therapist and treatment team after formal treatment ends. 
The key emphasis in beginning and ending individual sessions is on creat­
ing an emotional atmosphere that will enable the patient to interaa openly 
during the session and that will protect her as far as possible from uncon-
ttoUable negative emotions once the session is ended. Session time in individual 
therapy is struaured according to the DBT target hierarchy (decreasing suici­
dal behaviors, decreasing therapy-interfering behaviors, decreasing quality-
of-life-interfering behaviors, increasing behavioral skills, deaeasing posttrau­
matic stress, increasing self-respea, and achieving individual goals). Session 
stmcture in other modes of therapy (e.g., skills training, phone caUs, etc.) 
is determined by the target priorities of the particular mode of interaaion. 
(Stmcturing of skills training is discussed in the accompanying skiUs training 
manual.) 
There are no new acceptance or change strategies involved here. As in 
case management strategies, the focus in struaural strategies is on the tasks 
to be accomplished; thus, stmctural strategies ampHfy and integrate old strate­
gies rather than create new ones. Dialectical strategies and the core validat­
ing and problem-solving strategies form the backbone of the structural 
strategies.

438 STRATEGIES FOR SPECIFIC TASKS 
CONTRACTING STRATEGIES: STARTING TREATMENT 
The first task in meeting a potential patient is to orient the patient to DBT 
and develop an initial treatment contract with the patient. This contract then 
forms the basis of all future treatment. 
Contracting strategies are used during the first several meetings with the 
patient to orient her to what DBT is about, what is expeaed of her, what 
she can expect of the therapist, and how and why the treatment is expeaed 
to work. The goal is to forge a commitment between patient and therapist 
to work together as a therapy team. Contracting is the application of the 
orienting and commitment strategies (from problem solving; see Chapter 9) 
to the initiation of therapy. Thereafter, these strategies are reapplied when 
the patient (1) is violating the therapy contraa or is threatening to do so (e.g., 
says she is quitting skills training); (2) is threatening suicide or parasuicide; 
(3) appears to be making unrealistic demands or to have unrealistic expeaa­
tions of the therapist; (4) is having difficulty using therapy appropriately (e.g., 
doesn't call the therapist when it would be appropriate to do so because of 
fear of imposing). In short, the treatment contract is remade over and over 
Specific contracting strategies are summarized in Table 14.1 and are discussed 
below. 
I. CONDUCTING A DIAGNOSTIC ASSESSMENT 
If a structured diagnostic interview has not been conducted previously, a first 
task during the contracting phase is to conduct such an interview and obtain 
a detailed behavioral and psychiatric history, concentrating particularly on 
the patient's previous experiences in psychotherapy. In our clinic, we use the 
Struaured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R, Axis II (SCID-II; Spitzer & WU­
liams, 1990), as well as the revised version of the Diagnostic Interview for 
Borderiines (DIB-R; Zanarini et al., 1989). 
There are a number of requisite patient charaaeristics for DBT. The most 
important of these is voluntary participation. DBT requires at least the pos­
sibility of a collaborative relationship, continuing the relationship with the 
therapist can only be used as a positive contingency when a patient wants 
to be in the treatment program. Contingency management is thus seriously 
compromised with an involuntary patient. Court-ordered treatment is accept­
able if the patient will agree to remain in therapy even if the therapist gets 
the court order lifted. 
In my experience, a local residence is also desirable. Patients who do not 
live in the immediate area (i.e., transportation time of 1 hour or less) or who 
must move to the area for therapy wUl have difficulty finding the community 
social support and resources they need to tolerate the stress of therapy; thus, 
they will be more likely to terminate early. An additional patient characteris­
tic needed for group therapy is the ability to control hostility toward others. 
Borderiine groups with an overtiy hostUe member are greatiy handicapped.

In the research demonstrating the efficacy of DBT, patients were screened 
for aaive psychosis and organic mental disorders. For a non-research-oriented 
application of DBT, such screening would be needed only to the degree that 
significant cognitive impairments such as inability to attend to or grasp skill 
concepts would prevent patients from benefiting from the skills training. The 
presence of substance dependence is not grounds for exclusion except in a 
case where the patient cannot benefit from other treatment before the depen­
dence is eliminated. In principle, there is no reason why DBT cannot be modi­
fied to treat primary substance abuse problems. Several of our patients, 
however, were referred to short-term substance abuse inpatient programs be­
fore being admitted to DBT. 
2. PRESENTING THE BIOSOCIAL THEORY 
OF BORDERLINE BEHAVIOR 
During the first or several sessions, the therapist should present the dialecti-
cal/biosocial point of view on parasuicidal behavior and BPD (see Chapter 
2). Suicidal behavior should be presented as an attempt by individuals in pain 
to solve problems in living. Thus, suicidal behavior does not differ in princi­
ple from other maladaptive behaviors, except that it has a high risk of being 
fatal. Although the function of parasuicide can vary over time, across situa-
--- Page 460 ---
Structural Strategies 441 
tions, and among individuals, some functional characteristics of parasuici­
dal behavior are common to most suicidal persons. These characteristics 
should be described and discussed with the patient. It is best if this discus­
sion can be a Socratic one, in which the patient herself generates many of 
the functions. The therapist should be careful to present the functions of 
parasuicide as common to many people, without implying that the particu­
lar patient is necessarily like other individuals. 
In this context, it is also important that the nature of a functional rela­
tionship be described to the patient. As I have discussed in Chapters 9 and 
10, it is not uncommon for a patient to understand a therapist's presentation 
of funaional relationships as somehow implying that the person is consciously 
intending to achieve particular goals via parasuicide. Thus, the therapist should 
make clear to the patient that a particular behavior-outcome relationship does 
not necessarily mean that the person consciously (or unconsciously) intend­
ed such an outcome. On the other hand, the patient should be helped to see 
that such consequences can serve to reinforce parasuicidal behavior even if 
the patient does not wish this to be so. The therapist can do much to bolster 
the patient's confidence by specifically addressing this issue at the very begin­
ning, since the patient no doubt has been told by significant others that her 
suiddai behavior is conscious and manipulative. This point has been discussed 
at some lengths in Chapters 1 and 9. 
The patient should also be presented with the model of how borderline 
behaviors develop from a combination of emotional dysregulation and an in­
validating environment (see Chapter 2). Once again, the therapist should 
present the model in a Socratic manner, eliciting confirmation or disconfir­
mation from the patient as the discussion goes along. Although DBT rests 
on a firm theoretical model, the task during the contracting phase (and 
throughout therapy) is to develop and modify the theory so that it fits the 
particular patient. 
It is helpful at this time to draw on a blackboard a list of skills that bor­
derline individuals are presumed to lack (see the companion manual to this 
volume for an outiine of this material). Although this same material is present­
ed in skiUs training, it benefits from repetition in each mode of treatment. 
After describing what each of the skills consists of, it is then useful to discuss 
the interdependence among the skills in a humorous or slightly dramatic 
fashion, to give the patient an appreciation and understanding of the origin 
of her own sense of frustration in trying to develop one set of skUls when 
she doesn't have a second set of skills required for learning the first. 
For example, because the individual can not tolerate aversive environ­
ments, she is unlikely to learn self-control. Any effective self-control program 
has to be conducted in small steps, and therefore requires a tolerance of the 
aversive state of affairs for a period of time. Of course, if the patient had self-
control skills she would find tolerating aversive environments much easier, 
since the lack of such tolerance is often a result of the patient's sense that 
the situation will never improve because of her lack of skills at improving 
--- Page 461 ---
442 STRATEGIES FOR SPECIFIC TASKS 
the situation. Similarly, learning to control emotions is contingent on having 
the self-control skills needed to carry out a program of leaming the behaviors 
needed for emotion regulation. However, putting such a plan into action is 
hampered by the very lack of emotion regulation skills. Highly intense emo­
tions make it difficult even to remember what steps to carry out, and inevita­
bly tempt the patient to jettison the weU-thought-out behavioral management 
plan in favor of trying to get rid of the painful affect by some quicker but 
maladaptive means. 
As these examples indicate, it is quite easy to show the patient how in­
terdependent the behavioral skills are. At this point, it is helpful to point out 
to the patient that it's just "luck of the draw" that she may be deficient in 
each of these areas. Although the patient must be given hope that she can 
remedy these deficits, such a description can also help her see why she is feel­
ing frustrated. Such an understanding can presumably make it easier to tolerate 
the process of skill building that DBT involves. 
3. ORIENTING THE PATIENT TO TREATMENT 
The first several sessions of therapy involve orienting the patient to DBT and 
include a role induction aimed at giving the patient the appropriate informa­
tion about her role as a patient and the therapist's role as a therapist. The 
foUowing content should be covered during these sessions; the order of its 
presentation, however, can be individuaUy tailored. Again, it is advisable to 
elicit in the context of discussion as much as possible of the material from 
the patient, so that a minimum of didactic presentation is necessary. 
The therapy itself, as well as the number, form, and content of sessions, 
should be described clearly and in detail to the patient. In addition, these 
characteristics of DBT treatment philosophy should be described: 
1. DBT is supportive. The orientation of the DBT therapist is to be sup­
portive of the patient in her attempts both to decrease her suicidal behavior 
and to increase satisfaction with her life. In this regard, the DBT therapist 
will attempt to help the patient recognize her own positive attributes and 
strengths, and wUl encourage her both to develop these charaaeristics and 
to use them to enhance her life satisfaction. Now is the time to tell the pa­
tient that DBT is not a suicide prevention program; it is a life enhancement 
program. 
2. DBT is behavioral. A major focus of the therapy will be on helping 
the patient (a) learn to analyze her charaaeristic problematic behavioral pat­
terns, including the events that elicit them and their functional charaaeris­
tics, and (b) learn to replace maladaptive behavior with skillful behavior 
3. DBT is cognitive. Therapy will also focus on helping the patient 
change beliefs, expectations, and assumptions that she has leamed from her 
experience in previous settings but that are no longer effective or helpfiil. In 
addition, therapy wiU help her examine and change when necessary her style 
--- Page 462 ---
Structural Strategies 443 
of thinking, particularly her "aU-or-none" thinking and tendencies to be over-
judgmental (especially with respect to herself). 
4. DBT is skill-oriented. Both struaured skills training and individual 
therapy are designed to teach the patient new skUls and enhance the capabUi­
ties she already possesses. At least within structured skills training, the focus 
will be on mindfulness, interpersonal effectiveness, distress tolerance, self-
control, and emotion regulation skills. Individual therapy will focus on help­
ing the patient integrate the skills she is learning in skiUs training into her 
daily life. 
5. DBT balances acceptance and change. The therapy wUl focus on help­
ing the patient gain greater tolerance for painful feelings, for aversive environ­
ments, for ambiguity, and for the slow pace of change in general. A constant 
theme of therapy wUl be resolving the contradictions that arise from focus­
ing simultaneously on skiU enhancement and reality tolerance. It is often useful 
to point out to the patient that she probably often vaciUates between two seem­
ingly contradictory positions; several examples of this may be elicited from 
the patient at this point. For example, the patient may note that she vacillates 
between feeling hopeful and feeling hopeless, between feeling in total con­
trol and independent and feeling totally out of control and dependent, and 
so on. 
6. DBT requires a collaborative relationship. DBT requires the patient 
and therapist to funaion as a team to achieve the patient's goals. Toward this 
end, not only does the patient have to stay in the therapy, but both patient 
and therapist have to work constantly on their relationship behaviors so that 
they facUitate rather than hinder progress. Thus, a major focus of the treat­
ment will be on helping both patient and therapist adapt their characteristic 
interpersonal styles to the needs of the current relationship. 
4. ORIENTING THE NETWORK TO TREATMENT 
During the initial assessment, the therapist wUl have gathered information 
about the patient's interpersonal network and about all other current medi­
cal and psychological treatments. It is the therapist's responsibUity to see to 
it that the patient orients both her social and her medical/psychological treat­
ment network to DBT and her participation in it. If the nature of the ther-
apuetic relationship allows it, a therapist-patient joint meeting with one or 
more members of the patient's network may also be very useful. This can 
be particularly important with a highly suicidal patient, where communica­
tion of the high risk to the patient's entire network is almost always indi­
cated. (Involvement of the network in management of suicidal behaviors is 
discussed more fully in Chapter 15.) These initial network meetings are also 
an opportunity for the therapist to orient the network to the consultation-to-
the-patient strategies discussed in Chapter 13, to provide the network with 
the DBT theoretical formulation of BPD, and to gather further information 
about the patient and her network.

444 STRATEGIES FOR SPECIFIC TASKS 
5. REVIEWING TREATMENT AGREEMENTS AND LIMITS 
Patient and Therapist Agreements 
The patient agreements and therapist agreements, presented in Chapter 4, 
should be thoroughly discussed. There are six patient agreements (to enter 
and stay in therapy, to attend therapy, to work on reducing suicidal behavior, 
to work on therapy-interfering behaviors, to attend skiUs ttaining, and to abide 
by research and payment agreements) necessary for DBT. There are six ther­
apist agreements (to make every reasonable effort to be effeaive, to aa ethi­
cally, to be avaUable to the patient, to show respea for the patient, to maintain 
confidentiality, and to obtain consultation when needed). These agreements 
operationalize the DBT treatment philosophy discussed above. Their ration­
ale is discussed in Chapter 4, and I do not repeat it here. 
Availability of Phone Contact 
During the first session, the patient should be given phone numbers to con­
tact the therapist and avaUable emergency services in the community. The 
therapist's phone call limits should be discussed. If at this point the patient 
says that she could not possibly call a therapist, the therapist should discuss 
with her the DBT orientation to phone calls. In general, this is that not all 
of therapy can be done within the context of individual and skUls training 
sessions. Thus, it is necessary for the patient to call the therapist at times 
for individual coaching, especially in crisis situations when she is very tempted 
to engage in suicidal or other seriously maladaptive behaviors. Further strate­
gies regarding phone contact are discussed in Chapter 15. 
RecordinglTaping of Sessions 
If sessions are recorded, the patient should be advised of this. DBT advises 
recording both individual therapy sessions and skills training sessions; the 
role of these tapes in her treatment should be discussed. If having the patient 
listen to sessions between sessions is part of the treatment plan, the therapist 
should make arrangements for the patient to have a tape recorder to Hsten 
to tapes between sessions. The role of tapes in DBT, and problems that may 
arise with this procedure, are discussed in Chapter 11. 
6. COMMITTING TO THERAPY 
Formal therapy cannot begin until the patient and therapist have arrived at 
an agreement to work together, the patient commits to the patient agreements, 
and the therapist commits to the therapist agreements. This point cannot be 
overemphasized. The commitment strategies outlined in Chapter 9 are the 
principal means of gathering and strengthening the borderiine patient's com-
--- Page 464 ---
Structural Strategies 445 
mitment to the process and goals of DBT. Until the necessary verbal commit­
ments are made, the therapist should not proceed to discuss any other topic. 
There should be no investigations of the patient's past to get clues about her 
"resistance"; no discussions of the patient's emotional misery or Hfe chaos 
to get a better understanding of why she simply can't commit right now; no 
extended heart-to-hearts about the patient's relationship with the therapist 
(except as part of the initial orientation and mutual assessment) to see whether 
the patient can work with this particular therapist. This point is cruicial be­
cause the patients sometimes balk at one or more of the DBT commitments, 
saying that they aren't ready or able to make a commitment at that level right 
now. At the same time, they present themselves as so desperate that therapists 
become desperate to help as quickly as possible. 
Despite a patient's (and sometimes a therapist's) desperation, if the pa­
tient refuses to make the six necessary patient agreements as noted above, 
the therapist should accept the patient's statement, but remain firm nonethe­
less that therapy cannot proceed without these agreements. Starting therapy 
without the requisite patient commitment is like being a train engineer who 
is in such a hurry to get the train passengers somewhere that he or she starts 
the engine car out of the station before the passenger cars are securely fastened. 
No matter how fast that engine goes, those passengers left in the station are 
not going to reach their destination any faster Borderline patients typically 
have great difficulty making a commitment to work on reducing parasuicide 
and suicide risk. How to obtain this commitment is discussed in detail in 
Chapters 9 and 15, so I do not go into it further here. 
It is sometimes so easy to focus on getting a commitment from the pa­
tient that the therapist forgets to consider carefully whether his or her treat­
ment can actually help the patient as much as or better than available 
alternative treatments, and whether he or she aaually wants to treat this par­
ticular patient. When individuals come to treatment in crisis, ready and will­
ing to commit to anything, it is particularly easy to rush into treating them 
without giving this the careful consideration such a commitment warrants. 
FacUe promises of therapy can readily inspire hope in a desperate patient, but 
for just this reason they may be extremely difficult to break without serious 
damage to the patient. In most cases, the therapist should not promise con­
tinuing treatment during the first session. I usually tell a potential patient 
that we will use the first two or three sessions to assess whether we can work 
together and whether the person's problems are the type that I am able to 
treat. Between sessions, I consider whether I am able and wiUing to offer poten­
tially effective treatment for this particular individual; if so, a firm commit­
ment is made during the second or third session. If not, I help the per­
son find alternative treatment. Occasionally, I have suggested that a patient 
enter and complete an alternative treatment (e.g., a substance abuse pro­
gram or a structured, long-term DBT inpatient program) and then return to 
see me.

7. CONDUCTING ANALYSES OF MAJOR TARGET BEHAVIORS 
During the first few sessions, the therapist should condua a comprehensive 
behavioral analysis for each major instance of parasuicidal behavior that the 
patient can remember Serious problems with previous treatments should also 
be examined. Generally, I do at least a detailed analysis of each premature 
termination of therapy. When treatment moves to the second phase of treat­
ment (or if therapy begins here), a comprehensive analysis of posttraumatic 
stress responses should be conducted. Here, the therapist may need first to 
identify different pattems and then to select one or two instances in each pat­
tern for more in-depth analysis. The focus should be on current rather than 
past stress responses. Guidelines for how to conduct such analyses are given 
in Chapter 9. If therapy is carried out in a research context, the research as­
sessments can be used as guides to these analyses. But, in any case, they should 
not be skipped in the interest of getting to interventions quickly. Not only 
are they vital for obtaining information and clarifying patterns, but they help 
the patient to develop explanations for her behavior as neither "mad" nor 
"bad" (see Chapter 9 for further discussion). 
8. BEGINNING TO DEVELOP THE THERAPEUTIC RELATIONSHIP 
Observing Relationship Patterns in Contracting Sessions 
An essential task of these initial contracting sessions is to begin establishing 
a positive interpersonal relationship. These sessions offer an opportunity for 
both patient and therapist to explore problems that may arise in establishing 
and maintaining a therapeutic alliance. The assessment and contracting ses­
sions themselves serve as a sample of the patient-clinician interaction pat­
tern, and may be useful in predicting future patterns. In-session patterns, 
response variability, and the like should therefore be carefully observed and 
documented for subsequent analysis. 
Conveying Expertise, Credibility, and Efficacy 
Expertise, credibility, and efficacy may be conveyed in a variety of ways. In 
general, many of the strategies and techniques of DBT are designed to en­
hance the efficacy of the therapist. Expertise can be communicated by inter­
personal stylistic charaaeristics such as dressing professionally, being interested 
and relaxed, assuming a comfortable but attentive sitting position, speaking 
fluentiy with confidence and assurance, and being prepared for the therapy 
session. The therapist can also disclose his or her title, institutional affUia­
tion, and academic and professional experience with cases similar to the pa­
tient's particular situation and experience, as well as with the treatment 
approach to be followed. Credibility is influenced by such characteristics as 
reliability, dependability, predictability, and consistency. Particularly impor­
tant for the suicidal patient is her perception of the therapist's presumed mo-
--- Page 466 ---

tives and intentions in conduaing the treatment. Therefore, it is important 
to attend to such factors as carrying out agreements, starting the sessions on 
time, and communicating a clear interest in the patient as a person rather 
than only as a customer or a research subject. 
The credibUity of the treattnent and therapist can sometimes be enhanced 
if the therapist can arrange for the patient to undergo a positive, dramatic 
learning experience in the first several sessions. For example, teaching a pa­
tient briefly how to relax or how to let go of emotional arousal in a session 
can sometimes have a dramatic effect on the patient's belief in the therapist. 
The crisis survival strategies (see the accompanying skills training manual) 
can have much the same effect. 
Caveats in the Real World 
I have presented the contraaing strategies in a very straightforward manner, 
which implies that therapy actuaUy proceeds through the strategies much as 
I have outlined here. Often, however, this is not the case. This is particularly 
so when the patient enters therapy in a serious life crisis, is very serious about 
kiUing herself, or has such severe therapy-interfering behaviors that nothing 
can be accomplished untU these behaviors are modified. The therapist may 
need to use a crisis intervention treatment model (see Chapter 15) for quite 
some time at the very beginning of treatment. In these cases, the therapist 
should add extra time at the beginning (usually one session is sufficient) to 
orient the patient to the basics of the treatment and obtain the rudimentary 
commitments necessary. These two things (orientation and commitment) sim­
ply have to be done before anything else. Formal diagnostic assessment may 
be best handled by a colleague or another therapist in the clinic. Presenting 
the DBT biosocial theory, assessing major target behaviors, taking a history, 
and orienting the social network may aU have to be worked into the treat­
ment later 
For example, a patient was referred to me for outpatient therapy follow­
ing three near-lethal suicide attempts during the previous 9 months, all in­
volving cuts to arteries in the throat. The patient had also drunk poison 12 
times in the past year, and had so many self-infliaed burns that skin grafting 
had been required. After committing herself to work on these behaviors dur­
ing the first session, the patient was immediately ambivalent about whether 
to live or kill herself, and could only commit to trying her best not to kill 
herself the next time she felt a strong urge to die. (Her dissociative states were 
a complicating factor, and she maintained that she was helpless during these 
states to control her own behavior) Since almost overwhelming suicide urges 
were frequent and the desire to die almost continuous, therapy proceeded to 
concentrate on helping the patient stay alive and relatively uninjured. As I 
said to the patient repeatedly, we would get to work on her problems and 
on getting to know each other as soon as we had her suicidal behaviors un­
der control. This took 3 months of nonstop effort, including several inpa-
--- Page 467 ---
448 STRATEGIES FOR SPECIFIC TASKS 
tient admissions and exploration of altemative treatment options. As the risk 
of immediate suicide, at least, receded, I began the history taking and assess­
ment I would have ordinarUy conducted much closer to the beginning of 
therapy. 
A second example involved a patient seen in our clinic by a male ther­
apist. (A female therapist, which the patient preferred, was not available; un­
fortunately, we could not find her any altemative treatment in the community.) 
This patient entered therapy, made the requisite agreements, and then almost 
immediately was seized by intense fears about being in therapy with a male. 
By the third week, a pattern had developed: The patient would leave five or 
six messages per week stating that she could not go through with therapy, 
could not see such an inexperienced therapist, could not be in such an ill-
advised treatment program, could not continue a therapy where people were 
so insensitive, could not continue if we continued to require simultaneous 
skills training, and so on and so on. Requests for a call back would be can­
celed within an hour or two with a message that she was terminating therapy 
and the therapist should not blame himself. The patient would miss two or 
three sessions, repair her doubts over the phone or in a session, and then with­
in hours of repair and recommitment (tenative though it was) would re-enter 
the cycle. Therapy focused on nothing but this pattern of therapy-interfering 
behavior (which was a step improved from her pattem in previous therapies 
of threatening suicide at the same rate) for the first 4 months. Diagnostic as­
sessment was handled by a colleague. History taking and assessment of other 
target problems were put off. 
SESSION-BEGINNING STRATEGIES 
How a session begins is important in any psychotherapy. The beginning sets 
the tone for the remainder of the session. A patient often expects the ther­
apist to approach her with a negative or rejecting attitude. She sometimes 
comes to sessions with dread, prepared to withdraw or flee; this is especiaUy 
likely if the preceding interaaion was intense and negative. Most borderline 
patients have not learned that negative emotions come and go, and that 
problems can be resolved. Without such experiences, negative encounters can 
take on catastrophic import. Meeting the patient repeatedly with a warm, 
inviting attitude can graduaUy teach her that anger, frustration, relationship 
problems, and mistakes on her part do not necessarily lead to abandonment 
or irreparable emotional strain. Self-soothing, which is necessary for keep­
ing escalating emotions under some control, becomes considerably easier as 
a result. 
A word on possible settings for therapy is in order her In my clinic, the 
therapist's clinical practice office has routinely been the setting for individual 
DBT sessions and has generally been satisfactory. Another important setting 
for DBT is the telephone call, which has been discussed to some extent al-

ready and is treated more extensively in the next chapter; environmental in­
tervention strategies may occur in vivo. For some adolescent patients who 
are highly ambivalent about therapy, flexibility in setting can be extremely 
important for therapy retention. Out-of-office sessions in places such as bowl­
ing aUeys and cars can be helpful in continuing contaa through difficult 
phases. The same end might perhaps be accompHshed by simply remaining 
in touch until the adolescent comes for an office appointment, but with a 
limit of four consecutive absences, this is not praaical. It is also possible that 
such alternative meeting places are more natural environments for some 
adolescents and can be better tolerated in the midst of the traumas in their 
lives. 
Strategies to keep in mind when beginning therapy are discussed below 
and are outlined in Table 14.2. 
I. GREETING THE PATIENT 
Generally the therapist should greet the patient warmly, in such a manner 
as to express obvious pleasure at seeing the patient again. This will usually 
involve smiling at the patient and, if she has missed one or more sessions, 
commenting on how good it is to see her again. The object is to communi­
cate value and liking for the patient at the initial encounter 
2. RECOGNIZINGTHE PATIENT'S 
CURRENT EMOTIONAL STATE 
It is important to recognize the patient's current emotional state when begin­
ning the session. Hidden agendas on the patient's (or the therapist's) part 
should be brought out in the open. If topics are pressing to the patient, this 
should be noted. An informal agenda can be set at the beginning of the ses­
sion so that both parties know what topics need to be discussed and in what 
order they will be discussed. The targeting strategies, discussed below, are 
cmcial in this agenda setting. 
--- Page 469 ---
450 STRATEGIES FOR SPECIFIC TASKS 
3. REPAIRING THE RELATIONSHIP 
With few exceptions, relationship repair, at least briefly, should precede other 
serious work within the session. However, a "heart-to-heart" should not be 
substituted for targeting high-priority behaviors within the session. The 
dangers of this temptation are discussed more extensively in Chapter 12. 
A therapist who is ambivalent about meeting with the patient, anxious 
about difficult material that must be discussed, or still frustrated with the 
patient should examine carefuUy whether he or she actually wishes to resolve 
these conflicts with the patient. If the answer is no, the problem should be 
addressed in the next supervision/consultation team meeting; a certain amount 
of repair work, away from the patient, may be needed before the topic is 
broached with the patient. If the answer is yes, the therapist should use the 
reciprocal communication strategies (see Chapter 12) and therapeutic rela­
tionship strategies (see Chapter 15) to discuss the relationship with the pa­
tient and begin problem solving. 
TARGETING STRATEGIES 
Targeting strategues have to do with how the therapist structures the time 
during individual therapy sessions and what topics receive attention. They 
were developed to reflect the DBT emphasis on hierarchical organization of 
treatment targets and to insure that therapists would attend to the hierarchi­
cal ordering necessary in DBT. Implementing the targeting strategies requires 
integrating almost all of the previous treatment strategies. It can be extreme­
ly difficult in the first phase of DBT, because both patient and therapist often 
do not want to attend to targeted behaviors. 
The rationale for the targeting strategies, and various objeaions to and 
difficulties with them (as well as potential solutions), have been discussed 
extensively in Chapters 5 and 6. It bears repeating here, however, that a ther­
apist who ignores the targeting strategies is not doing DBT. That is, in DBT 
what is discussed is as important as how it is discussed. Difficulties in get­
ting a patient to go along with the targeting strategies should be treated as 
any therapy-interfering behavior is treated; how to do this is discussed in the 
next chapter A therapist who is having trouble following the targeting strate­
gies (a not unlikely problem) should bring up the topic in the supervision/con­
sultation meeting. Other therapists will almost certainly be having the same 
trouble. 
Because I have already gone through the rationale for targeting at such 
length in other chapters, I do not go through it again here. It can be useful 
to look at targeting as setting an agenda. Although the agenda must remain 
flexible, depending on the patient's behavior during the week, it can nonethe­
less, be useful to review it before and after each session. The targeting strate­
gies are described below and are summarized in Table 14.3. Although these 
strategies can be used in any order, all should be used every session.

T REVIEWS P's PROGRESS since last contaa. 
During first and second phases of treatment, diary card is collected and 
scanned by T in an obvious way, so that its importance is clear to P 
If P does not bring the diary card, reasons are elicited; when ap­
propriate, therapy-interfering behavior protocols (see Chapter 
15) are utilized. 
If P does not bring in the diary card, T asks P about any suicidal 
behaviors during the previous week (as weU as other behaviors 
being tracked on the diary cards; T has P fill out card in 
session, if appropriate. 
Any unusual or problematic responses are commented on; pro­
gress is reinforced. 
T asks about progress on any behavioral assignments. 
_ T uses BEHAVIORAL TARGET PRIORITIES to organize session. 
If suicidal behavior is reported (other than recurrent, low-level suicide 
ideation), T discusses this, using problem-solving strategies; T em­
ploys suicidal behavior protocols (see Chapter 15). 
If misery is high and suicide ideation is low, and/or if self-harm 
urges are high and there is no parasuicide, T comments and at­
tends to high misery/urges, validating that P's problems are im­
portant even when they are not accompanied by suicidal 
behaviors. 
If therapy-interfering or quality-of-life-interfering behaviors are present, 
they are discussed and problem solving (general or in regard to the 
relationship) is used. 
If P's phone calls are a current target, or if any unusual calls oc­
curred during the previous week, they are reviewed during the 
session. 
When required targets (suicidal behaviors, therapy-interfering be­
haviors, quality-of-life-interfering behaviors, posttraumatic stress) 
have been addressed, P allows T to control session content and 
direction.

I. REVIEWING TARGET BEHAVIORS 
SINCE THE LAST SESSION 
The first therapeutic task in each session is to review with the patient her 
behavioral progress during the past week. In the first two stages of DBT, this 
inquiry is ordinarUy structured by the therapist to obtain specific informa­
tion about target behaviors. 
Diary Cards 
I begin every session with the simple question "Do you have your diary card.'" 
(See Chapter 6 for a description of diary cards.) If the patient has it, I im­
mediately scan it and from the card determine an initial agenda for the ses­
sion. If the patient does not have the card, I ask whether she filled it out, 
what happened to it, and so on. If it was filled out but for one reason or 
another the patient did not bring it in, I quickly review the information oral­
ly. Specific questions depend on the stage of therapy and the current behavioral 
targets, although I usually try to get most of the card's mformation (on parasui-
cideal behavior and urges, suicide ideation and urges, substance use [includ­
ing medications], daily misery, use of behavioral skills, and anything else we 
are monitoring). If she did not fill it out, I ordinarily give her a card to fill 
out whUe I wait during the session. As I have noted in Chapter 6, this type 
of consistent attention to diary cards tends to produce compliance sooner 
or later (If not, it would be an instance of therapy-interfering behavior, and 
thus subject to even more attention.) The rationale for diary cards, as well 
as taaics for responding to both therapist and patient resistance to cards, is 
discussed in Chapter 6 and again in Chapter 15. 
Homework Assignments 
If homeworks assignments are given, the therapist must remember to ask about 
them during the session. 
--- Page 472 ---
Structural Strategies 453 
2. USING TARGET PRIORITIES TO ORGANIZE SESSIONS 
As I discuss on a number of occasions, one of the distinctive charaaeristics 
of DBT is the use of behavioral target priorities to organize interaaions. The 
basic rules are as follow. Individual psychotherapy time is oriented to current 
behaviors (since the last session), and priority for attention is determined by 
the target hierarchy. To remind the reader of that hierarchy (see Chapter 6), 
the highest priority in individual outpatient therapy is accorded to suicidal 
behaviors, followed by therapy-interfering behaviors, serious quality-of-life-
interfering behaviors, skiU deficits, posttraumatic stress behaviors, self-respea, 
and individual goals, in that order In phone calls, the individual therapist 
also oi^anizes the interaction according to a target hierarchy: decreasing sui­
cide crisis behaviors, applying behavioral skiUs to the problem at hand, and 
resolving interpersonal crises or alienation between therapist and patient, in 
that order SkiUs training sessions, supportive process groups, and all other 
modes of treatment have their own individual hierarchies. The task of each 
therapist is to use the order for the current interaaion mode in guiding use 
of time. This particular strategy is one of the most difficult for new ther­
apists and one of the most important to the overall progress of the therapy. 
(See Chapters 5 and 6 for a full discussion of using target priorities. Organiz­
ing time and coping with resistance are discussed extensively in Chapters 6 
and 15.) 
3. ATTENDING TO STAGES OF THERAPY 
As also discussed in Chapter 6, DBT is organized into four stages: the pretreat­
ment stage of orientation and commitment; Stage 1, attaining basic capaci­
ties; Stage 2, reducing posttraumatic stress; and Stage 3, increasing self-respea 
and meeting individual patient goals. It is important for the therapist to at­
tend to these stages—not moving therapy to a higher stage before goals of 
the current stage have been met, and moving therapy back a stage when 
problems of a previous stage reappear The necessity of completing orienta­
tion and commitment (pretreatment) before beginning therapy per se is dis­
cussed above. As I have discussed more fuUy in Chapter 6, it is equally 
important to make substantial progress in Stage 1 before moving to Stage 2. 
The stages strategy also informs the therapist that previous traumatic stress 
cannot be ignored in DBT. Thus, in the absence of a compelling rationale, 
skipping from attaining basic capacities to meeting individual goals (other 
than temporarily) would generally be a violation of this strategy. 
4. CHECKING PROGRESS IN OTHER MODES OF THERAPY 
In individual psychotherapy, when the patient is simultaneously engaged in 
other modes of DBT (such as skills training), the therapist should check 
progress in these other modes each session. The individual therapist must 
--- Page 473 ---
454 STRATEGIES FOR SPECIFIC TASKS 
remember that he or she is the primary therapist, and thus is responsible for 
coordinating all treatment modes. It is difficult for most patients to believe 
that a particular mode of therapy is important if the individual therapist does 
not believe it is important enough even to ask about. Problems in attendence 
or cooperation with other modes of treatment are also the responsibility of 
the individual therapist and are treated as therapy-interfering behaviors. 
SESSION-ENDING STRATEGIES 
How a session with a borderline and suicidal patient ends can be extremely 
important. Borderline patients not infrequently leave therapy sessions with 
such intense negative emotions, including anger, fmstration, panic, grief, hope­
lessness, despair, emptiness, and aloneness, that they have great difficiUty toler­
ating the emotional pain without resorting to maladaptive behavior It is very 
important to anticipate these emotions and work with them as "problems 
to be solved." It is equally important to conclude and summarize the "busi­
ness" part of the session—that is, to review homework given and summarize 
the progress made in the session. Strategies for ending sessions are outlined 
in Table 14.4. 
I. PROVIDING SUFFICIENT TIME FOR CLOSURE 
When the ending of a session begins depends on the particular patient. For 
some patients, the ending begins at the beginning. That is, they are so anx­
ious about leaving that their behavior from the very beginning of the session 
is influenced by the salient fact that the interaction is, in their words, "almost 
over before it begins." As I have noted previously, borderline patients often 
say that they cannot and will not "open up" emotionally during sessions be­
cause once they do so, there is insufficient time for "closing up." They are 
left with intense emotions that they cannot regulate. Although this problem 
cannot be completely averted no matter how long a session is, each therapist 
and patient should work out together how many minutes should be left at 
the end of sessions to do the important closure work. The time needed wUl 
certainly vary both across patients and within a patient, depending on the 
material discussed during the session. 
2. AGREEING ON HOMEWORK FOR THE COMING WEEK 
During the course of the session, the patient and therapist may discuss vari­
ous aaivities that the patient should engage in during the coming week. At 
the end of each session, any suggestions for homework should be reviewed 
and clarified, and the patient's agreement to engage in the assignment should 
be reaffirmed. At this point, the therapist should ask the patient whether she 
sees any problems in completing the assignment during the coming week.

and employed that are comfortable for both T and P. 
Anti-DBT tactics 
_ T ends early without warning P. 
_ T brings up sensitive material just before session ending. 
_ T invalidates P's difficulties with ending and leaving session. 
Generally it should be assumed that there will be such problems, and the ther­
apist should take this opportunity to help the patient troubleshoot these. 
3. SUMMARIZING THE SESSION 
When appropriate, the therapist should summarize at the end of a session 
the important points that have been covered. Generally, such a summary 
should be offered in an "upbeat" fashion. Important insights that the patient 
has gained during the preceding week or the session should be briefly men­
tioned. At times, only a sentence or two is needed here. 
4. GIVING THE PATIENT A TAPE OF THE SESSION 
At the end of each session (if this is part of the plan), the patient should be 
given a copy of the session audiotape, with instructions to listen to it at least 
once during the coming week. The tape can serve as a stimulus for the pa­
tient to cope when she is feeling overwhelmed, and is a way to make the ther­
apist present, so to speak, in the patient's natural environment. 
--- Page 475 ---
456 STRATEGIES FOR SPECIFIC TASKS 
5. CHEERLEADING 
At the end of each session, the therapist should direaly and openly encourage 
the patient on progress that she is making, and should point out to the pa­
tient some positive attribute or praiseworthy behavior. Essentially, this is an 
opportunity for the therapist to validate the patient's behavior without the 
patient's having to ask for it. This is also an opportunity for the therapist 
to offer hope and encouragement to the patient. Encouragement from the 
therapist is especially important if a substantial part of the session has been 
devoted to helping the patient become more aware of self-defeating behaviors 
on her part. Quite often, the patient will feel discouraged and hopeless but 
will communicate competence to the therapist. It is important that the ther­
apist not be fooled by such apparent competence. The therapist must be careful 
to combine praise with validation of how terribly hard and painful the pa­
tient's life StiU is, and should not overestimate the patient's ability to cope 
on her own. As therapy progresses, the therapist can usefully begin to elicit 
from the patient encouraging and self-validating statements. In the latter half 
of therapy, the therapist may ask the patient direaly what progress she sees 
during the prior week or during the current session. 
6. SOOTHING AND REASSURING THE PATIENT 
A patient often feels bereft at leaving a therapy session. Her sense of despera­
tion and aloneness resurges as the session draws to a close. The therapist 
should anticipate this and remind the patient that she can call the therapist 
if need be before the next session; that is, contact is not irrevocably ended. 
The therapist should remind her also that she can call emergency services 
at any time and can ask other people in her environment for help if need be. 
As noted previously, a parasuicidal and borderline patient often has great trou­
ble asking for help appropriately. Although she may frequently call the ther­
apist in the midst of a crisis, acting and feeling desperate and making 
inappropriate demands on the therapist, she very rarely calls the therapist 
to ask for help before a crisis is reached. 
In the beginning of therapy, a main goal is to teach the patient how to 
ask for help appropriately. It is especially important for the patient to learn 
that she can call someone simply to discuss problems, ask for advice, or even 
just share what is going on with her It is usually very difficult for the patient 
to do this, and in the first stages of therapy calling the therapist may need 
to become a homework assignment. Once the patient is comfortable calling 
the therapist during a crisis, she should be instructed at the end of sessions 
to try caUing the therapist before a crisis arises. Once the patient is able to 
call the therapist appropriately, attention should be directed toward gener­
alizing this skill to other people in her environment. At this point, the ther­
apist may discover that the patient has very few supportive people whom she 
can caU appropriately; this issue may then become an important focus of ther-
--- Page 476 ---
Structural Strategies 457 
apy. In any event, a major objective of therapy is to make the patient capable 
of calling on other people in her environment for appropriate help by the time 
the therapy is ended. 
7. TROUBLESHOOTING 
If the patient continues to have considerable emotional difficulty at the close 
of a session, the therapist should help the patient develop emotion regula­
tion and distress tolerance strategies for use after leaving. Again, it is partic­
ularly important not to be fooled by the patient's apparent competence. 
Certainly at the beginning, almost aU patients will have considerable difficulty 
handling session endings. Although the emotional pain will decrease over time 
on its own, both therapist and patient should attend actively to developing 
problem-solving solutions for aUeviating the emotional pain and forestalling 
maladaptive patterns of coping. 
8. DEVELOPING ENDING RITUALS 
The development of ending rituals can be soothing for the patient and make 
parting easier At a minimum, the therapist should accompany the patient 
to the door and convey the expeaation that they will meet again soon. For 
some patients, a good-bye hug may become an important part of session end­
ing (see Chapter 12 for guidelines). 
TERMINATING STRATEGIES 
It is essential to prepare the patient for termination of therapy from the very 
beginning. As in any strong and positive intimate relationship, ending can 
be extremely difficult. DBT does not advocate a complete rupture in the rela­
tionship; instead, the patient moves from the category of patient to that of 
ex-patient, and the therapist goes from the role of therapist to that of ex-
therapist. "Ex-" roles are quite different from "non-" roles. In the former, the 
faa of a once intense and intense positive attachment is recognized and valued. 
The change is akin to the transformation from student to former student, 
or from dependent child to emancipated adult chUd. Successful termination 
also requires that the interpersonal skUls the patient has leamed with the ther­
apist generalize to nontherapeutic situations. Specific strategies for attending 
to therapy termination are outlined in Table 14.5

T begins ACTIVELY PLANNNING for termination at least 3 months before

T uses problem-solvilng strategies to troubleshoot difficulties with ter-

T helps P determine criteria for re-entering therapy, reviewing 
skills, or otherwise becoming more active in problem solving

time before therapy ends. The timing, however, will depend on how long the 
therapy is continued. To make the transition out of therapy smoother, thera­
py sessions should be "tapered off in frequency, rather than stopped abrupt­
ly. During this process of active termination, the therapist emphasizes and 
praises the progress of the patient; expresses clear confidence in her ability 
to live independently outside of therapy; and emphasizes that caring and con­
cern for the patient will not stop simply because therapy is terminated, and 
that community and/or private resources remain available for the patient if 
the need arises. 
2. GENERALIZING INTERPERSONAL RELIANCE 
TO THE SOCIAL NETWORK 
The ordinary course of events in therapy with a parasuicidal and borderline 
patient is that the patient will initially have great difficulty in trusting the 
therapist, in asking the therapist for help, and in arriving at a optimum balance 
between independence and dependence; as discussed earlier Exploration of 
these patterns will often indicate that they are also occurring wfth others in 
the patient's environment. Essentially, the ability to ask for help is a neces­
sary skill for survival in what is often an aversive environment. Thus the abil­
ity to trust, to ask for help appropriately, and both to depend on someone 
and to be self-reliant will often be objectives of treatment. 
--- Page 478 ---
Structural Strategies 459 
As the patient begins to develop trust in the therapist, she will generally 
begin to be more honest with the therapist about her need for help. During 
the initial stages of therapy, strong emphasis is put on reinforcing the patient 
for calling the therapist for help when she is having trouble coping with a 
particular situation. However, if this ability to request help is not transferred 
to other people in the patient's environment, and if the patient is not also 
taught to render assistance to herself, termination of therapy will be extremely 
traumatic. Even in very short-term absences of the therapist (e.g., on out-
of-town trips), a parasuicidal patient is quite likely to react with parasui­
cidal behavior Thus, the transition from reliance on the therapist to self-
reliance and reliance on others must begin almost immediately. Once again, 
the dialectic strategies should be employed; in this case, the therapist empha­
sizes being able to depend on other people while learning to be indepen­
dent. 
3. ACTIVELY PLANNING FOR TERMINATION 
As noted above, the fact of therapy termination should be discussed during 
the very first sessions of DBT. Termination from therapy and termination from 
the therapist, however, should be clearly differentiated. Moreover, the role 
of ex-therapist and the role of friend should be equaUy well differentiated. 
With few exceptions, ex-therapists do not become personal friends with 
former patients, and such an expeaation should not be created. If a friend­
ship does emerge, it will be an unexpected delight rather than an expected 
right. 
Troubleshooting 
The therapist should discuss with the patient any difficulties that may be ex­
peaed to arise during or immediately following termination. Problem-solving 
strategies should be used to develop solutions. Included among potential so­
lutions should be the possibihty of "booster sessions." It is sometimes a good 
idea to plan these sessions, perhaps at 6-month intervals, even when problems 
are not expeaed. 
Evaluating Progress 
Sufficient time should be given to a reasonably thorough review of how ther­
apy has progressed, what gains have been achieved, and what further progress 
the patient would Hke to make in her life. Both the therapeutic relationship 
itself (from the therapist's and the patient's perspeaives) and patient's changes 
in targeted behaviors should be reviewed. The therapist should present the 
idea that no one is ever completely "cured" of troubles, and that all of life 
involves growth and change. 
--- Page 479 ---
460 STRATEGIES FOR SPECIFIC TASKS 
Setting Up Ground Rules for Continued Contact 
The roles of ex-therapist and ex-patient have been insufficiently explored in 
the psychotherapy literature. It is extremely important that the therapist have 
a clear idea of his or her own preferences about future interaction with the 
patient. This idea should be presented clearly to the patient; making vague 
promises that will not be kept does her no favor In the normal course of 
events, ex-patients' contaa with their ex-therapists may be quite frequent im­
mediately foUowing therapy termination and for a year or so thereafter, and 
then will gradually fade in frequency. Since I am almost always interested in 
keeping up with former patients over the long run, much as I am with former 
students, I encourage them to stay in touch periodically so that I will know 
how they are doing. This is the time for interweaving of reciprocal communi­
cation and observing limits. 
The patient's wishes for continued interaction with the therapist should 
also be explored. Some want more contact than others; some may actually 
want a complete break in contact. Both parties should outline the criteria 
for re-entry into therapy. If re-entry is impossible, the therapist should be clear 
about that and help the patient apply problem-solving to the issue of how 
to find another therapist. 
4. MAKING APPROPRIATE REFERRALS 
In a perfea world, therapy with the borderline patient would progress through 
Stages 1, 2, and 3 and would end with a patient who is reasonably satisfied 
with her life and at peace with herself. For a patient entering at Stage 1, this 
can take a number of years. Indeed, for the seriously suicidal borderline pa­
tient, even progressing from Stage 1 to Stage 2 can take at least a year and 
often longer Depending on the severity of previous trauma and tendencies 
to dissociate. Stage 2 therapy can also take a year or more. At least until we 
develop more effective and more efficient therapies, trying to hurry patients 
through these stages sometimes creates more problems than it solves. 
Unfortunately, because of financial and insurance limitations, dictates 
of managed care, personal limitations of the therapist, and/or research re­
strictions, it is often not possible for a therapist and patient to remain as a 
team for the time necessary to achieve these goals. It is essential in these in­
stances that the therapist not abandon the patient. That is, the therapist must 
assist the patient in making alternative treatment follow-up plans. For all the 
reasons cited above, making these plans can be extraordinarily difficult for 
the patient who lacks financial resources to pay for private therapy. An addi­
tional problem is the reluctance of many private therapists to see borderline 
and/or suicidal patients for therapy. The therapist may need to explore both 
public and low-cost private mental health resources, as well as peer counsel­
ing and support groups (e.g.. Alcoholics Anonymous). If the therapist knows 
at the start that therapy will be time-limited, then planning for referral should 
start well before the end of therapy.

Concluding Connments 
My patients often ask me whether they will ever get better, whether they will 
ever be happy. It is a difficult question to answer Surely they can get better 
and happier than they are when they first come to see me. And, yes, I believe 
that life can be worth living even for a person who has at one time met criter­
ia for BPD. I am less certain, however, whether anyone can ever completely 
overcome the effeas of the extremely abusive environments many of my pa­
tients have experienced. Some amount of grieving may be necessary over their 
whole lives. The important thing here is not to catastrophize this reality. Many 
people over history have had to face and accept extraordinarily painful events; 
yet they have gone on and developed lives of reasonable quality or fulfillment. 
Of course, how to do this is not completely obvious, nor is it easy. Psychother­
apy is only a small part of the attempts made by society to confront this dilem­
ma. The limits of psychotherapy may be circumvented by involvement in 
religion, spiritual practices, study of literature, history or phUosophy, com­
munity activities, and so on. That is, many answers will be found outside 
of psychotherapy. 
Nor will aU individuals find and maintain the loving, nurturing, and sup­
portive interpersonal relationships they so frequently desire. At least, they may 
not find these qualities in one relationship; even if they do establish such a 
relationship, it may not be permanent. The relationship with the therapist 
may be the best one an individual ever finds—not necessarUy because of defi­
ciencies on her part, but because the abiHty of our society to provide com­
munity and companionship is limited, even for many of its best members. 
Supportive group therapy following termination of individual therapy may 
be a good option for many former borderline patients. Some may want to 
continue in such groups indefinitely; I think that this should be encouraged 
and supported. With others, ongoing if intermittent contaa with their former 
therapists may be very important.

Special Treatment 
Strategies 
I his chapter covers strategies for re­
sponding to specific problems and issues in treatment with borderline pa­
tients. Like structural strategies, these strategies require the combination of 
standard strategies in new and unique ways. Integrative strategies for respond­
ing to the foUowing are discussed here: (1) patient crises, (2) suiddai behaviors, 
(3) patient therapy-interfering behaviors, (4) telephone caUs, (5) ancUlary tteat-
ments, and (6) patient-therapist relationship issues. 
CRISIS STRATEGIES 
As noted throughout this book, borderline patients are often in a state of cri­
sis. Such a state inevitably lessens a patient's ability to use behavioral skiUs 
she has been learning. Emotional arousal interferes with cognitive process­
ing, thereby limiting the patient's ability to focus on anything other than the 
present crisis. In these instances, the therapist should employ the crisis response 
format described in this section. 
In standard outpatient DBT, the responsibility for assisting a patient in 
crisis belongs to the individual or primary therapist. Other outpatient ther­
apists and team members should (1) refer the patient to her primary ther­
apist, assisting her in making contact if necessary; and (2) help the patient 
apply distress tolerance skUls until she reaches her primary therapist. This 
division of labor can be very important in effectively treating the patient who 
calls other treatment staff members whenever she can't get hold of her primary 
therapist immediately, or who "shops around" for a sympathetic response 
when she doesn't like her primary therapist's response. Many of the crisis 
response strategies outiined in Table 15.1 and discussed below may prove useful 
in this limited task. DBT does not advocate, as a usual practice, an "on-caU"

procedure in which patients in crisis can only talk to whichever team mem­
ber is on call that day. (See the discussion of telephone strategies, below, for 
futher comments.) In other settings, such as inpatient or day treatment, respon­
sibUity for crisis intervention might be assigned to other members of the treat­
ment team. 
I. PAYING ATTENTION TO AFFECT 
RATHER THAN CONTENT 
Paying attention to the patient's affea rather than to the content of a crisis 
is especially important when a patient is emotionally aroused. Techniques 
for vaHdating emotional experiences are described in Chapter 8. In summary, 
a therapist should identify the patient's feelings, communicate to the patient 
the validity of her feelings, provide an opportunity for emotional ventUation, 
verbally reflect to the patient his or her own emotional responses to the pa­
tient's feeHngs, and offer refleaive statements. 
2. EXPLORING THE PROBLEM NOW 
Focusing on Time Period since Last Contact 
In a state of high emotional arousal, an individual quite often loses track of 
the event that precipitated the emotional response in the first place. She may 
attend not only to the precipitating event, but to all similar events that have 
occurred either in her whole life or in the past several weeks. Thus, one event 
may have set off the crisis, but the patient may rapidly switch from one topic 
to another in trying to communicate what is happening to her A ther-
--- Page 483 ---
464 STRATEGIES FOR SPECIFIC TASKS 
apist should concentrate on helping the patient focus on what exactly has 
happened since the last contact, instead of drawn into a discussion of all the 
negative events in the patient's life. 
Trying to Identify Key Precipitants of the Current Crisis 
Frequently a very minor event wiU set off an overwhelming crisis response. 
In these instances, it is critical that the therapist help the patient identify this 
precipitating event. Often, the patient will list a whole series of unmanagea­
ble events and conditions in her life. The therapist should listen and respond 
selectively—that is, respond only to workable material and ignore irrelevant 
and/or unmanageable aspects of the story. In this context, the patient should 
be asked to be both concrete and specific in describing what is happening 
to her 
The therapist should selea some portion of the patient's crisis response, 
such as her feeling overwhelmed, hopeless, desperate, suicidal, and so on, 
and ask the patient to pinpoint just exactly when that response first began, 
when it increased or decreased, and so on. For example, if the feeling is ter­
ror, the therapist might frequently ask, "Did you feel terror at that point?" 
If the answer is yes, the therapist might follow with "And did you feel terror 
right before he said 'X, Y, or Z?" If the answer is yes, the therapist goes back 
in time moment by moment to find the exact comment or event that set off 
the terror. A bit later in the story, the therapist might say, "And did that in­
crease or decrease the terror?" and so on. The idea is to constantly link a 
specific patient crisis response (or set of responses) to a specific event or ser­
ies of events. 
Formulating and Summarize the Problem Situation 
Problem formulation and summary may be needed repeatedly during a crisis 
session; a therapist should focus on arriving at agreement as to the definition 
of the problem's main elements. Quite often, the patient will be focusing on 
solutions to the problem without adequately defining the problem. Of course, 
a main solution often put forward by the patient is suicidal behavior The 
therapist should be very alert to a patient's tendency to state a suicidal be­
havior as a problem instead of as a solution. 
Thus the patient may say, "The problem is that I want to kill myself." 
The therapist should emphatically and directly communicate that suicidal be­
havior is not a problem, but is rather a solution to a problem. The therapist 
may say, "OK. That's a solution to a problem. Let's figure out exactly when 
that first thought of killing yourself entered your mind. When did you first 
think of it? What set it off?" Once that moment is identified, the therapist 
can then explore what about that event is so problematic that it elicited the 
urge to commit suicide. For some individuals, thoughts of suicide are simply 
overlearned responses to any problematic event, or painful emotions or in-
--- Page 484 ---
Special Treatment Strategies 465 
terpretations of the event may have intervened. As one can see, finding the 
precipitating event is usually the most direa route to figuring out the problem 
situation. Such an analysis should be followed by immediately reformulating 
the problem and by eliciting and reinforcing agreement from the patient when 
possible. 
3. FOCUSING ON PROBLEM SOLVING 
Once again, the therapist is faced with trying to synthesize contradiaory points 
of view. The therapist must help the patient reduce the aversive, negative emo­
tions while at the same time helping the patient see that the ability to put 
up with some unpleasant affea is necessary for arousal reduction. If problem-
solving techniques are utilized here, it is almost always essential to selea some 
small area of the current crisis for attention. The patient will often commu­
nicate an intense desire to "make everything OK right now"; the therapist 
should model breaking a problem down into small parts and dealing with 
one aspect at a time. In problem solving during a crisis, the procedure below 
should be followed, in addition to the standard problem-solving techniques 
described in Chapter 9. 
Giving Advice and Making Direct Suggestions 
In DBT, the therapist funaions in multiple roles (consultant, teacher, cheer­
leader, etc.). Although it is preferable to adopt the consultant role in helping 
the patient choose from among several response altematives she has generat­
ed, there are times when the patient simply does not know what to do or 
how to handle a given situation. In these instances, it is appropriate for the 
therapist to give the patient conaete advice and make direa suggestions about 
possible action plans. This is especiaUy important in dealing with an "appar­
entiy competent patient. In such a case, it is very common for a therapist 
to assume that the patient aaually could figure out what to do, but simply 
lacks confidence in her ovm abUity. It is easy to make the mistake of refusing 
to give the patient advice under the mistaken theory that the patient does 
not need it. Thus, it is important to assess the patient's capabilities carefully 
and to respea the patient's knowledge of her own capabihties. A patient's 
passivity must not be unUaterally interpreted as lack of motivation, resistance, 
lack of confidence, or the like. Many times, passivity is a funaion of inade­
quate knowledge and/or skills. 
Offering a Solution Based on tiie Behavioral Skills the Patient Is Learning 
All problems can be solved in more than one way; it depends on one's per­
speaive. The abUity to employ the perspective of behavioral skiUs when gener­
ating problem solutions is crucial in DBT. Thus, when distress tolerance is 
the current treatment module (or a set of skills the therapist wishes the 
--- Page 485 ---
466 STRATEGIES FOR SPECIFIC TASKS 
patient to praaice), a crisis can be viewed as one in which distress tolerance 
is needed. If interpersonal effectiveness is the focus, the problem can be framed 
as related to interpersonal actions. Generally, events become "problems" be­
cause they are assodated with aversive emotional responses; one solution might 
be for the patient to change her emotional response to the situation. An ef­
feaive response might be cast in terms of mindfulness skills. The ability to 
apply any of the behavioral skills to any problematic situation is at once im­
portant and very difficult. Therapists must themselves know the behavioral 
skills inside and out, and be able to think about them quickly during a crises. 
An example may be helpful here. Suppose a patient comes to a session 
and during the review of her week begins crying, saying that she simply can­
not talk about her week because it is too upsetting. The therapist can take 
any of the following paths. First, the therapist can comment that the patient 
seems to be experiencing high distress, and can encourage her to focus on 
which skills she could use at this very moment to tolerate the pain she is 
feeling—indeed, to tolerate it well enough to plunge into a discussion of the 
week. Second, the therapist can focus the discussion on helping the patient 
evaluate her goals at this moment in interaaing with the therapist. What in­
terpersonal skills could she use right now to meet her objeaives? What does 
she need to say or do so that she will feel good about herself when this inter­
action is over? How does she want the therapist to feel about her once this 
interaaion is over and what could she now say or do to be effeaive here? 
Third, the therapist can focus the discussion on identifying the current emo­
tion and generating ideas about how to feel better right now. FinaUy, depending 
on which mindfiilness skiU is being taught (or which the patient needs to prac­
tice), the therapist can suggest that she focus on observing or describing her 
current state or that she try to respond to herself in this moment in a non-
judgemental fashion; that she refocus her attention on just this moment and 
the task at hand; or that she consider right now what she needs to do to fo­
cus on what "works." 
Predicting Future Consequences of Various Plans of Action 
Suicidal and borderline patients often focus on short-term gain and ignore 
long-term consequences of their behavioral choices. A therapist should urge 
a patient to focus on long-term consequences of her behavior The patient 
should be helped to examine the pros and cons of various action alternatives 
in terms of their effectiveness at achieving objectives, at maintaining inter­
personal relationships, and at helping the patient respea and feel better about 
herself. 
Confronting the Patient's Ideas or Behavior Directiy 
In the midst of a crisis and high emotional arousal, it is unusual for a patient 
to be able to examine the pros and cons of various aaion plans calmly. When 
--- Page 486 ---
Special Treatment Strategies 467 
the therapist believes that a given course of action will have detrimental ef­
fects, he or she should confront the patient directly about the outcomes of 
her behavioral choice. Frequently, choices will be linked to unrealistic beliefs 
on the part of the patient; in these instances, the patient's beliefs must also 
be confronted. When the therapist confronts a patient who is in a state of 
intense emotional arousal, the patient wiU frequently respond with statements 
indicating that the therapist does not really understand her situation. In these 
instances, it is helpful to express understanding and validation of the pain 
the patient is experiencing, and to follow this by indicating a belief that an 
altemative aaion choice, even though painful, would be preferable in the long 
term. 
Clarifying and Reinforcing Adaptive Responses 
As a patient begins to leam adaptive cognitive and behavioral responses, these 
responses must be reinforced. During a crisis, it is beneficial to attend care­
fully to any adaptive responses or ideas generated, to help clarify them, and 
then to reinforce these responses. At other times, the therapist can refer to 
other occasions when the patient has dealt with similar situations adaptively 
and can praise such behaviors. 
Identifying Factors Interfering with Productive Plans of Action 
Once the patient and therapist have identified a plan of action that appears 
productive, the therapist should help the patient identify factors that might 
interfere with the plan. If this step is neglected, the patient is likely to ex­
perience faUure; consequently, problem solving in the future will be more 
difficult. The identification of faaors interfering with produaive plans should 
be followed, of course, by further discussion of how these problems can be 
solved. 
4. FOCUSING ON AFFECT TOLERANCE 
Generally, the patient wUl communicate to the therapist her inability to tolerate 
the crisis situation: Not only is the situation overwhelming, but she can't stand 
it. While validating the patient's pain, the therapist must also directly con­
front the patient wfth the necessity of tolerating the negative affect. It is fre­
quently helpful to make a statement such as this: "If I could take away your 
pain, I would. But I can't. Nor, it appears, can you. I'm sorry for the pain 
you are in, but for the moment you have to tolerate it. Going through the 
pain is the only way out." The patient should not be expected to empathize 
with this point of view in the eariy stages of therapy. However, this should 
not deter the therapist from making these statements repeatedly throughout 
these stages. 
--- Page 487 ---
468 STRATEGIES FOR SPECIFIC TASKS 
5. OBTAINING COMMITMENT TO A PLAN OF ACTION 
The therapist should make every effort to persuade the patient to agree to 
a plan of action that specifies what both the patient and the therapist will 
do between now and the next contaa. An explicit, time-limited contract— 
one that includes demands or requirements the patient must fulfill before the 
next contact—should be negotiated. In other words, the therapist must com­
municate to the patient that she is expeaed to take the agreed-upon steps 
to begin to resolve her current crisis. 
6. ASSESSING SUICIDE POTENTIAL 
At the end of every crisis interaction, the therapist should reassess the pa­
tient's suicide risk. The patient may begin such an interaction by saying she 
is going to kill herself, injure herself, or engage in some other destruaive ac­
tion. Despite a therapist's best efforts, the patient may stiU maintain this point 
of view at the end of the interaction. The therapist should check whether 
the crisis has been aUeviated suffidently that the patient believes she can refrain 
from killing herself between this interaaion and the next contaa. If the pa­
tient cannot agree to this, the therapist should move to the suicidal behavior 
strategies, described next. 
7. ANTICIPATING A RECURRENCE 
OF THE CRISIS RESPONSE 
Together, the therapist and patient will often formulate an action plan that 
promises to reduce the patient's current feelings of being overwhelmed. 
Although these plans may in faa be quite helpful, the patient wUl commonly 
experience a resurgence of the overwhelming affea (after a short period of 
time). Thus, during a crisis the therapist should take responsibility for help­
ing the patient plan or structure her time between the current contact and 
the next contact. The patient should be warned that the aversive feeHngs are 
very likely to recur and that several strategies for coping with such feelings 
should be planned. 
SUICIDAL BEHAVIOR STRATEGIES 
Treatment of suicidal individuals requires a structured protocol for respond­
ing to suicidal behaviors, including suidde crisis behaviors, parasuidde, threats 
of suicide or parasuicide, suicide ideation, and ui^es to engage in parasui­
cide. This protocol may be implemented within or following a treatment ses­
sion, on the telephone, in a hospital setting, or (less frequentiy) the therapist's 
or patient's ordinary environment. Information about suicidal behavior may 
be spontaneously communicated to the therapist, may be elicited from the pa-
--- Page 488 ---
Special Treatment Strategies 469 
tient by questioning, or may be obtained via phone calls to the therapist from 
other professionals or from concemed individuals in the patient's environment. 
The Therapeutic Task 
The task of the therapist in responding to suicidal behavior is twofold: (1) 
responding aaively enough to block the patient from aaually kUling or seri­
ously harming herself; and (2) responding in a fashion that reduces the prob-
abiHty of subsequent suicidal behavior The requirements of these two tasks 
often conflict. A dialectical tension arises between the demands of keeping 
a patient safe and the demands of teaching the patient behavioral patterns 
that wiU make staying alive worthwhile. Complicating all of this are the fears 
almost all therapists have of being held responsible for a patient's death if 
a false step is taken or a mistake made. The strategies described below are 
designed to address both the therapeutic needs of the patient and the limits 
of the therapist. 
How a therapist responds to any single instance of suicidal behavior or 
threat will always be mitigated by characteristics of the individual patient, 
her situation, and the therapeutic relationship. There are only three arbitrary 
rules in DBT concerning suicidal behavior (which, of course, must be com­
municated to the patient during treatment orientation). First, parasuicidal aas 
and suicide crisis behaviors are always analyzed in depth; they are never ig­
nored. Second, a patient who engages in parasuiddal aas cannot call her ther­
apist for 24 hours following the aa, except in a medical emergency where 
she needs the therapist to save her Hfe. Even then, the patient should call emer­
gency services and not the therapist. Third, potentialy lethal patients are not 
given lethal drugs. (This last point is discussed further under anciUary treat­
ment strategies, below.) 
Suiddai behavior strategies should be implemented in at least four situ­
ations: (1) The patient reports previous suicidal behavior to her individual 
or primary therapist during an individual therapy session (and is not now 
at any medical risk); (2) the patient threatens imminent suicide or parasui­
cide to her primary therapist; (3) the patient engages in parasuicide while 
in contact with her primary therapist, or contaas him or her immediately 
following a parasuicidal aa; (4) the patient reports or threatens suicidal be­
havior to a collateral therapist. When the patient is in crisis and also suici­
dal, the crisis strategies just described should be integrated with the steps 
outlined in this section and summarized in Table 15.2.

havior during any therapy interaaion, including phone conversations, skills

FOR PRIMARY THERAPIST, WHEN THREATS OF IMMINENT 
SUICIDE OR PARASUICIDE ARE OCCURRING: 
T ASSESSES the risk of suicide or parasuicide. 
T uses known faaors related to suicide behavior to predia long-term 
risk. 
T uses known factors related to imminent suicidal behavior to predia 
imminent risk. 
T makes, keeps available, and uses a crisis planning sheet. 
T knows the likely lethality of various suicide/parasuicide methods. 
T consults with emergency services or medical consultant about medi­
cal risk of planned and/or available method(s). 
T REMOVES or gets P to remove lethal items. 
_T EMPHATICALLY INSTRUCTS P not to commit suidde or engage in 
parasuicide. 
_ T maintains position that suicide is NOT A GOOD SOLUTION. 
T generates HOPEFUL statements and solutions. 
_ T keeps CONTACT and keeps to TREATMENT PLAN when suidde risk 
is imminent and high. 
T is more active when suicide risk is high. 
T generally does not actively intervene to prevent parasuicide unless 
medical risk is high. 
T is more conservative with new P. 
T assesses whether suicidal behavior is respondent behavior 
T attempts to stop the eliciting events. 
T teaches P how to prevent them in the future. 
T assess whether suicidal behavior is operant behavior 
T searches for response that both meets the requirements of the 
treatment plan and is also a natural contingency. 
T provides a somewhat aversive contingency—a therapeutic 
response that is not a reinforcing response. 
T searches for an optimal response that is natural, reduces eliciting 
factors (behavior as respondent), and minimally reinforces (behavior 
as operant).

diary cards colleaed at the beginning of each individual therapy session ask 
for information on daUy suicide ideation and urges to engage in parasuicide, 
and also ask whether or not the patient aaually engaged in a parasuicidal 
act since the previous individual therapy session. Without faU, this informa­
tion should be reviewed by the therapist at the beginning of each individual 
therapy session. How the therapist responds to reports of previous suicidal

behaviors wUl influence the probabUity of subsequent suiddai behaviors. Great 
care is needed. 
If either suicide crisis behaviors (e.g., suicide threats) or parasuicidal aas 
have occurred since the last individual therapy session, problem-solving strate­
gies are implemented. DetaUed analyses of previous suicidal behaviors, how­
ever, are only conduaed during individual sessions. If the primary therapist 
hears between sessions (from the patient or another source) about previous 
parasuicide or suicide crisis behaviors, including threats made to others, in­
tervention directed at that behavior should be postponed until the next ses­
sion, unless the patient is in danger of further behavior or is at medical risk. 
The first step in responding to prior parasuicidal behavior is to conduct 
a detailed and thorough behavioral assessment. This assessment is always 
conduaed during the next individual therapy session (although its timing with­
in the session is optional). At times, the behavioral analysis can take an en­
tire session; it will generally take at least 15 to 20 minutes. (If it is any shorter, 
either the therapist or the patient is probably avoiding the topic.) A solution 
analysis follows, or is interwoven. The therapist and patient examine what 
other behaviors could have been employed or could be used the next time. 
Often a number of points can be identified where a different response might 
have led to a different outcome. The behavioral and solution analyses lead, 
optimally, to relapse prevention planning—an approach developed by Alan 
Marlatt (Marlatt & Gordon, 1985) for treating alcoholics. 
There simply are no exceptions to the implementation of these strate­
gies. Their use does not depend on whether a behavior is medically severe 
or high in risk versus less severe or lower in risk; on the mood or cooperation 
of the patient (or the mood of the therapist); or on whether other, more im­
mediate crises have come up since the suicidal behavior The strategies are 
also not short-circuited if the patient says she does not remember or does 
not know the answer to a question. In such instances, the therapist simply 
analyzes what led up to the point where the patient's memory has faded, and 
picks up at the next point in time. If no cooperative behavior occurs, then 
the therapist moves back to the commitment strategies (see Chapter 9) or to 
the therapy-interfering behavior strategies (described below). If time is short, 
the therapist should shorten the solution analysis in favor of the behavior 
analysis. If there is current suicide crisis behavior that must be attended to 
immediately, previous suicide crisis behavior or parasuicide is next on the 
priority list, even if it must await the next session. 
Over time, behavior analyses wiU go faster as the typical precipitants 
of suiddai behaviors become darified. However, therapists of patients in long-
term therapy should be cautious about assuming that they understand cur­
rent suiddai behaviors on the basis of their information about past behavior 
The determinants of suicidal behaviors can and do change over time. 
As I have discussed in Chapters 9 and 10, behavioral analysis (and, to 
a lesser extent, solution analysis) can be considered use of behavioral correc­
tion and overcorreaion-a contingency management procedure. Discussing 
past suiade aisis behaviors and parasuidde can be aversive for a number 
--- Page 492 ---
Special Treatment Strategies 473 
of reasons. It requires effort; the patient has to focus her attention, rather 
than speaking of what comes to mind without effort. Often shame is assodated 
with thinking and talking about suicidal aaions. Talking about suicidal be­
haviors also means that other topics important to the patient may not be dis­
cussed because of time constraints. 
If parasuidde and suicide crisis behaviors have not occurred since the 
last session, the therapist should focus on any suicide ideation or urges to 
engage in parasuicide that have occurred, as well as the cognitive and affec­
tive components of suicidal behavior The amount of time and attention de­
voted to discussion of ideation and urges is rarely as extensive as that afforded 
to suicide crisis behaviors and parasuicide. At times only a question or two, 
or a highlighting comment, is needed. Low levels of these behaviors are not 
addressed in every instance; otherwise, there would be little time for atten­
tion to other targets. 
Reinforcement of nonsuicidal responses to events that previously elicit­
ed a suicidal response is crucial untU changes are stabilized. Sometimes, 
however, the only evidence of these nonsuicidal responses is an absence of 
or decrease in suicidal behaviors. In my experience, many therapists have great 
difficulty spending time on suicidal behaviors that do not occur Since the 
entire topic is so aversive to both a patient and a therapist, it often seems 
easier just to ignore it. However, an analysis of how the patient actually avoids 
suiddai behaviors, especially in the presence of high suicide ideation, parasui­
cidal urges, and/or general misery, can be extremely useful in affording op­
portunities for the therapist to reinforce altemative problem-solving behaviors. 
Attention should be faded over time to insure that resistance to suicidal be­
haviors comes under the control of natural reinforcers. 
Within the individual session, the following steps should be taken. 
I. ASSESSING FREQUENCY. INTENSITY, 
AND SEVERITY OF SUICIDAL BEHAVIOR 
The first step in responding to a patient's previous suicidal behavior is to ob­
tain detailed, descriptive information. When suicide crisis behaviors have oc­
curred in an interaaion with the therapist, these behaviors are reviewed to 
be sure there is agreement on just what the behaviors were, including what 
was said, how it was said, and any other aaivities engaged in (writing a sui­
cide note, obtaining lethal means, etc.). If the suidde threat was made to other 
mental health professionals, a description of exaaly what was said and done, 
how it was said and done, and under what drcumstances is obtained. Descrip­
tive case notes should be written following the session. 
With respect to parasuicidal acts, the therapist assesses the exact nature 
of the self-injurious behavior (e.g., where and how deep was the cut, exactly 
what chemicals or drugs were ingested and how much), the environmental 
context (alone vs. with others), the physical effeas, any medical attention 
that was needed, the presence of accompanying suicide ideation, and cons­
cious intentions the patient can recall. The therapist should carefuUy assess 
--- Page 493 ---
474 STRATEGIES FOR SPECIFIC TASKS 
the aaual lethality or medical risk of the parasuicide episode. The scale points 
listed in Appendix 15.1 can be used. This scale, developed by Smith, Conroy, 
and Ehler (1984) and then updated by Bongar (1991), can be reliably used 
by nonmedical clinicians and does not depend on a patient's willingness to 
accmrately discuss her "intent" at the time of the parasuicide episode. Instruc­
tions for use of the scale were provided by Smith et al. and have also been 
updated by Bongar 
The frequency and emotional intensity of suicidal ideation since the last 
contact should be explored. As noted above, continued suicide ideation and 
parasuicidal urges do not always need to be discussed; however, significant 
changes (either increases or decreases) should be explored, even if only brief­
ly. Periodically, the therapist should assess whether the patient has made plans 
to attempt suicide and has the means needed to carry out a suicide attempt; 
similar information should be elicited regarding parasuicidal urges. It is par­
ticularly important to keep up on whether or not the patient is obtaining and 
keeping parasuidde implements (hoarding drugs, carrying razors around, etc.). 
A healthy suspicion is useful at times. 
2. CONDUCTING A CHAIN ANALYIS 
A chain analysis should be carried out in excruciating, moment-to-moment 
detail. The therapist should elicit enough detail to clarify the environmental 
events, emotional and cognitive responses, and overt actions that led up to 
the critical behavior, as well as the behavior's consequences (and thus the func­
tions it served). The starting point of the analysis is the moment the patient 
identifies as the beginning of the suicidal crisis, or the moment of the first 
thought or urge to commit suicide, threaten suicide, or engage in parasui­
cide. One indirect (but intended) consequence of such a detailed and specific 
assessment is that the questions —for example, "And did the thought of sui­
cide cross your mind then or before then?", "At that moment, were you feel­
ing like you wanted to kill yourself, or did that feeling come up later?", or 
"You said you feel suicidal because he is leaving you for another woman. Did 
that feeling (wanting to kill yourself or be dead) start the second he said he 
was leaving, or did you first start thinking about it or thinking about what 
it means for you and then start feeling suicidal?"-highlight that (contrary 
to the patient's beliefs) suicidal responses are not necessary responses to the 
moment under discussion. The assessment model set forth in Chapter 9 should 
be followed. 
3. DISCUSSING ALTERNATIVE SOLUTIONS VERSUS TOLERANCE 
Once the problematic situation has been identified, therapist and patient 
should discuss alternative solutions to the problematic situation that the pa­
tient could have used. The therapist should always suggest that one solution 
to the problem could have been simply to tolerate the painful consequences. 
--- Page 494 ---
Special Treatment Strategies 475 
including negative affect, that the situation has generated. Furthermore, it 
should be emphasized that there is always more than one possible solution 
to even the toughest problem. The model for solution analysis set forth in 
Chapter 9 should be followed. 
4. FOCUSING ON NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF SUICIDAL BEHAVIOR 
The therapist shoiUd enumerate or elicit from the patient the actual or potential 
negative effects of the suicidal behavior The strategies and procedures used 
here are those of solution analysis, contingency clarification, and at times 
reciprocal communication. It is important for the patient to begin to see the 
negative interpersonal consequences of both suicide crisis behaviors and 
parasuicidal acts. The patient may need considerable help in understanding 
the emotional impact of her behavior on others, as well as the seriousness 
with which suicidal behavior is viewed by others. The reciprocal communi­
cation strategies can be used to give the patient feedback on any negative im­
pact of the suicidal behaviors on the therapeutic relationship or on the 
therapist's feelings and attitudes toward the patient. 
Even if the behavior was conducted in private and negative environmen­
tal effeas are not immediately obvious, the therapist should point out that 
over the long run suicidal behavior is not going to work as a means of resolv­
ing problems, even if it does temporarily aUeviate painful affective states or 
obtain needed help from the environment. The negative effects of the suici­
dal behavior on the patient's self-esteem should be discussed. In the case of 
suicide ideation, the therapist should address the fact that thinking about sui­
dde in response to problems in living serves only to divert attention from ways 
of solving the problem to ways of escaping the problem. Threatening suicide 
or preparing for suicide can also divert the patient from finding more effec­
tive solutions, as well as create fiirther negatiave consequences of their own. 
5. REINFORCING NONSUICIDAL RESPONSES 
ft is important to reinforce the patient for coping with problematic situations 
in ways other than suicide crisis behaviors or parasuicide. The procedures 
described in Chapter 10 should be applied. Reinforcers may include increased 
therapist warmth, a more ambient therapeutic session, and control over the 
use of session time. Attention and posftive feedback are generally effective 
here, but the therapist must be very careful that praise is not interpreted as 
lack of concern about the patient's continued emotional distress. The patient's 
reports of high misery, but low suicide ideation or parasuicidal urges, should 
be met wfth as much care and concern as high suicide ideation. If the patient 
has to continue suicidal behavior to elicit concern and aaive therapeutic help, 
suiddai behaviors wiU undoubtedly continue. Also, the patient may weU need 
reassurance that therapy is not going to end just because her suicidal behavior 
is improving. 
--- Page 495 ---
476 STRATEGIES FOR SPECIFIC TASKS 
6. OBTAINING COMMITMENT TO 
A NONSUICIDAL BEHAVIORAL PLAN 
The therapist should help the patient make behavioral plans for avoiding sui­
ddai behavior in the future when encountering simUar problematic situations. 
Again, the solution analysis strategies outlined in Chapter 9 should be used. 
Frequently, the patient will maintain that there is no solution to the problem 
except suicidal behavior. Two responses are possible. First, the therapist can 
review with the patient her commitment to try her best to avoid suicidal be­
havior Second, the therapist can generate other altemative behaviors and elicit 
a commitment from the patient to try such behaviors on an experimental basis. 
One alternative behavior is for the patient to call for help before engaging 
in suicidal behaviors. 
7. VALIDATING THE PATIENT'S PAIN 
No matter how unreasonable the suiddai behavior may appear to be, the ther­
apist must always be careful to express understanding of the feelings of un­
bearable psychological pain that led the patient to engage in parasuicide or 
consider suicide. It is quite easy to get carried away with invalidating suicidal 
behavior as a solution to problems and to neglect to validate the feelings that 
led up to the behavior Shneidman (1992) puts this perspeaive most eloquently: 
Suicide is best understood as a combined movement toward cessation and a move­
ment away from intolerable, unendurable, unacceptable anguish. It is psycho­
logical pain of which I am speaking; "metapain," the pain of feeling pain. From 
a traditional psychodynamic view, hostility, shame, guUt, fear, protest, longing 
to join a deceased loved one, and the like have singly and in combination been 
identified as the root factor(s) in suicide. It is none of these; rather, it is the pain 
involved in any or all of them. (p. 54) 
Parasuicide differs from suicide only insofar as the movement toward cessa­
tion (i.e., death) may or may not be present. 
8. RELATING CURRENT BEHAVIOR TO OVERALL PATTERNS 
The therapist should help the patient see pattems of suicidal behavior that are 
occurring. The insight (interpretation) strategies, outiined in Chapter 9, con­
stitute the model here. Once such pattems become clear, the therapist and pa­
tient can focus more attention on learning how to generate desired outcomes 
in nonsuicidal ways or how to handle problematic situations more effectively 
THREATS OF IMMINENT SUICIDE OR PARASUICIDE: 
PROTOCOL FOR THE PRIMARY THERAPIST 
An aaive response is called for when a patient directiy or indirectly commu­
nicates an intent to commit suicide or to engage in a nonlethal parasuiddal 
aa. Such communications can occur under crisis conditions, and the therapist 
--- Page 496 ---
Special Treatment Strategies 477 
is faced with determining the immediate risk, possibly at an inconvenient time 
and over the telephone. In other instances, the patient's intent to engage in 
parasuicide or commft suicide may be communicated during a scheduled tteat­
ment session, with the suicidal behavior threatened to take place either very 
soon (e.g., that day) or only if some future event occurs (e.g., an anticipated 
rejection or faUure of the therapy). In the event of any threat, the following 
steps should be carried out. 
I. ASSESSING THE RISK OF SUICIDE OR PARASUICIDE 
Two types of risk assessment are crucial: short-term or imminent risk and 
long-term risk. The question in the assessment of long-term risk is whether 
the person falls into a group at high risk for suicide or parasuicide. Meeting 
criteria for BPD, for example, increases long-term risk for both. Being female 
increases risk for parasuicide and decreases risk for suidde. Age is positively 
correlated with suicide and negatively correlated with parasuicide. Factors 
related to long-term risk for both suicide and parasuicide are listed in Table 
15.3; these risk factors are discussed more extensively in Linehan (1981) and 
Linehan and Shearin (1988). Faaors that are useful in assessing risk for im­
minent suicide and parasuicide are listed in Table 15.4 and are also discussed 
extensively in Linehan (1981).^ Bongar (1991) and Maris, Berman, Malts-
berger, and Yufit (1992) also provide excellent reviews of risk assessment strate­
gies. Therapists must have the risk faaors so firmly committed to memory 
they are available to recall at a moment's notice. It is not possible to look 
these up in the middle of a crisis. 
Both persons who commit suicide and those who engage in nonlethal 
parasuicide acts frequently communicate their intent ahead of time. Border­
line patients who habitually engage in parasuicide, for example, may report 
urges or intentions to mutilate themselves, put themselves to sleep for a week, 
or the like. These individuals may make it very clear that they have no intent 
to commit suicide; a person planning to cut her wrists or arm, for instance, 
may communicate that she plans to cut herself to relieve unbearable tension. 
An individual planning suicide may simUarly be very direa about her plan 
to die. 
Patients also often think about or plan suicidal behavior without direct­
ly informing their therapists. A question, then, is whether a therapist ought 
to ask about suiddai ideation if a patient has not brought up the topic. Several 
events may suggest probing for suicidal ideation. The occurrence of any event 
known to have been a precipitant of prior parasuicide or suicide ideation 
should prompt such questioning. In addition, statements by the individual 
that she can't stand it any longer, wishes she were dead, believes others would 
be better off without her, or the like should alert the therapist to probe further 
Once it is clear that the patient is considering suicide or parasuicide, the 
therapist should move to an assessment of the immediate risk factors out­
lined in Table 15.4. It is extremely important that the therapist question the

patient about the method she intends to use (and whether the implements 
for such a method are currently available or easily obtained). In the case of 
a proposed drug overdose, the therapist should ask for the name of every dmg 
that is in the patient's possession now (or easily accessible), together with 
the number of piUs left and their dosage leve. In addition, the therapist should 
determine whether the patient has written a suicide note, has any plans for 
isolating herself, or has taken any precautions against discovery or interven­
tion. It is important also to assess how available other people are to her now 
and how avaUable they will be over the next several days. If the patient re­
fuses to divulge this information, the risk is, of course, higher The therapist 
should be alert to signs of severe or deepening depressive affea and of emerging 
panic attacks. If the risk assessment is taking place over the phone, it is im­
portant to determine whether the patient has been drinking or taking non-
prescribed drugs recently, where she is at the moment of the call, and where 
other people are in relationship to the patient.

(PDR) can be very useful in determining the specific drugs and dosage levels 
the patient has on hand or has ingested. Individuals who are not medically 
trained should not under ordinary circumstances make decisions about the 
lethality or medical risk of what a patient has ingested or is threatening to 
ingest. The effects of combining drugs with one another or with alcohol, 
specific medical conditions, the patient's weight, and other faaors make such 
decisions complicated. 
The response to a patient threatening suicide, however, will depend on 
the therapist's estimate of the actual risk of death or substantial harm. There­
fore, ft is important to make some attempt to ascertain the lethality of the 
drugs the patient has on hand or has ingested. There are a number of aids 
and procedures. First, the therapist should have a crisis planning sheet for­
mulated and kept up to date for the patient (see Figure 15.1). The crisis plan­
ning sheet should contain information about all of the prescription and 
nonprescription drugs the patient is known to possess or take, together 
--- Page 500 ---
Special Treatment Strategies 481 
with dosage levels, prescribing physician, and the patient's weight in kilograms. 
The crisis planning sheet should also indicate the average daily dose for each 
drug regularly taken or in the possession of the patient. It is important to 
remember that a dose that is not potentiaUy lethal can stUl be medically dan­
gerous. Thus, knowing the lethality of a drug is insufficient for a skUlful 
response. 
Second, a therapist who is not medically trained should always check 
an assessment of drug lethality immediately with a medically qualified per­
son. Sometimes, the problem here is getting anyone to provide the needed 
information, others are often afraid of liability. In my experience, the best 
place to call is the local public emergency room (preferably the busiest one). 
This is the place least likely to want unnecessary hospitalizations, and thus 
most likely to want to help. A therapist who knows the exaa dose taken or 
threatened, the patient's weight in kilograms, whether alcohol or illicit drugs 
are involved, and any medical problems the patient has can usually get a very 
good consultation. If the therapist cannot get a medical consultation, there 
is little choice but to err on the side of caution. 
Unless the therapist is medically trained, he or she should follow medi­
cal advice as to whether the patient must get medical attention. (If the ther­
apist is in doubt about the advice, a second consultation call can be placed 
to discuss the problem again.) This point cannot be made too strongly. It 
is very easy for a tired or overburdened therapist, who is in a rush to do some­
thing else, to underestimate the medical consequences of a drug overdose. 
Medical reactions can be delayed, and the fact that a patient is not groggy 
or looks OK is not sufficient reason for inaction. Often a therapist justifies 
inaction by deciding that requiring medical attention would reinforce the be­
havior, but this line of reasoning can sometimes have life-threatening conse­
quences. 
Other Lethal Means. Patients may threaten suicide by other means than 
a drug overdose. Thus, a therapist must know the likely lethality of various 
methods of suicide. Obviously, the threat to jump from 3 feet is lower than 
the threat to jump from 50 feet. Common methods, in decreasing order of 
lethality, are (1) firearms and explosives, (2) jumping from high places, (3) 
cutting and piercing vital organs, (4) hanging, (5) drowning (cannot swim), 
(6) poisoning (solids and liquids), (7) cutting and piercing nonvftal organs, 
(8) drowning (can swim), (9) poisoning (gases), and (10) analgesic and soporif­
ic substances. (Schutz, 1982). 
2. REMOVING OR CONVINCING THE PATIENT 
TO REMOVE LETHAL ITEMS 
Once the therapist has determined that the patient is suicidal and possesses 
lethal means, attention should be focused on convincing the patient to re­
move or dispose of the lethal items. During telephone conversations, this can

be done by instruaing the patient to throw potentially lethal drugs down the 
toUet or give them to another individual in the house. If the patient is both 
drinking alcohol and planning to take drugs, she should also be asked to dis­
pose of any available alcohol. Razor blades and other cutting instruments, 
matches, poisons, and so forth should be thrown in a trash bin outside the 
home. A gun or its ammunition can be locked in the trunk of a car or in 
a locker, and the key can be given to someone else. The general idea is to 
put distance and effort between the patient and the means; the therapist may 
need to be creative here. During a session, the patient should be asked to hand 
over whatever she has with her for safekeeping. 
The therapist should give these instruaions to the patient in a matter-
of-faa way, and communicate a positive expeaancy that the patient will in 
--- Page 503 ---
484 STRATEGIES FOR SPECIFIC TASKS 
faa carry them out. On the phone, the therapist should simply teU the pa­
tient what she is to do and wait whUe she disposes of the lethal items. If the 
suicidal threat occurs during a regular session, the patient should be instmaed 
to bring the lethal items to the next session, or even to go home and bring 
the items in immediately. Keeping lethal means around can be considered a 
therapy-interfering behavior and treated as such. This is the time for using 
reciprocal communication paired with observing limits. 
It is important that the therapist not be diverted from the task of remov­
ing lethal items. Possession of lethal means is often perceived by the patient 
as a safety factor; she may become very anxious at the prospect of removing 
any possibUity of kiUing herself. A useful rationale for removing lethal items 
is that the presence of such items may lead to an accidental suicide, even if 
in retrospeaive analysis of the situation she would probably not have dedd-
ed to kill herself. The therapist can also emphasize that the patient can al­
ways stock up on lethal items again at a future point. The removal of lethal 
items should be presented as a technique to give the patient more time to think, 
rather than an absolute ruling out of any suicidal behavior in the future. 
It is also important not to overfocus on the task when it becomes clear 
that the patient is simply not going to comply. The power struggle that en­
sues may be very hard to win. If the patient refuses, the therapist should sim­
ply back off and bring it up another day; persistence in bringing it up at 
opportune times should eventually result in success. However, the therapist 
should not underestimate the importance of the patient's bringing in lethal 
items or throwing them away. A patient of mine hoarded a stock of various 
medications that would have killed her many times over For 2 years she re­
fused to give them up, because they were her safety valve. She finally brought 
them in a box wrapped in black elearical tape, with a cross and flower taped 
to the top of the box. She had brought me her coffin, and this marked a sig­
nificant turning point in therapy. 
3. EMPHATICALLY INSTRUCTING THE PATIENT 
NOT TO COMMIT SUICIDE OR PARASUICIDE 
Often, it is helpful simply to tell the patient emphatically that she should not 
kill or harm herself. Once again, the therapist can tell the patient that refrain­
ing from suiddai behavior now does not prevent her from doing ft in the future. 
4. MAINTAINING THAT SUICIDE IS NOT A GOOD SOLUTION 
Suicidal patients often try to get their therapists to agree that suicide is a good 
solution, so that they can have "permission" to go ahead and kill themselves. 
ft is essential not to give such permission. Thus, a DBT therapist should never 
instruct a patient to go ahead and do something, under a mistaken assump­
tion that such statements may arouse in the patient sufficient anger and in­
hibit any suicidal behavior (i.e., the therapist should not use paradoxical 
--- Page 504 ---
Special Treatment Strategies 485 
instruction). Nor should the patient be "baited" with statements implying 
that she wUl never carry out her threats. Such statements may force the pa­
tient to prove that she is actually serious. Rather, the therapist should vali­
date the emotional pain that has led to suicidal behavior, while at the same 
time refusing to validate such behavior as an appropriate solution. (See Chapter 
5 for further arguments against suicidal behaviors.) 
5. GENERATING HOPEFUL STATEMENTS AND SOLUTIONS 
In some crises, the best thing the therapist can do is to generate as many 
hopeful statements and solutions as possible and hope that one of these will 
help the patient acknowledge that other solutions to the problem may exist. 
If one doesn't "catch," another should be proposed. I was once making an 
emergency home visit to a woman who was threatening suicide because her 
husband and children were treating her very cruelly. She felt completely hope­
less. I spent over an hour talking with her while my teammate spoke with 
the family. It was late and I wanted to resolve the crisis so I could go home. 
But nothing seemed to help, and she rejected every idea and solution I could 
think of. Finally, I said, "Well, just because your marriage and family may 
be a catastrophe doesn't mean that your whole life and future has to be a 
catastrophe." She looked at me in complete surprise and said, "I never thought 
of it that way but you are right." We talked another few minutes, and the 
crisis was resolved for the moment. I had expanded the boundaries of her 
frame, which led to a new interpretation of her life and allowed affective 
change. 
Focusing on the problem situation rather than on the planned suicidal 
behavior is useful, because undue emphasis on the latter will divert attention 
from finding alternative solutions. Some problems may be so complex that 
even the therapist is unable to arrive at alternatives likely to reduce the scope 
of the problem. In these instances, the therapist should simply state that 
although neither can think of a nonsuicidal solution at the moment, this does 
not prove there is no recourse but suicide. The finality of suicide as a solu­
tion can then be discussed, and the possibility of holding off on suicide can 
be presented. 
6. WHEN SUICIDE RISK IS IMMINENT AND HIGH: 
KEEPING CONTACT AND KEEPING TO THE TREATMENT PLAN 
Perhaps the most difficult treatment situation encountered by a therapist is 
that of the patient who convincingly threatens suicide, is alone, and refuses 
to be dissuaded from her purpose. The general rule is to stay in contact with 
the patient, either in person or by phone, until the therapist is convinced that 
the patient will be safe (from suicide or serious harm) once contact is broken 
off. If possible, a therapy session or phone call should be extended until the 
therapist is able to develop a satisfactory plan with the patient. A home visit 
--- Page 505 ---
486 STRATEGIES FOR SPECIFIC TASKS 
may be called for if such a visit will not inadvertently reinforce the suicide 
communication. Home visits in DBT must be carried out with another team 
member (never alone), and a male therapist should always be accompanied 
by a female therapist. Home visits are extremely rare in DBT. 
A therapist who is unable to stay in contaa should elicit help from sig­
nificant others, family members, or other treatment personnel (such as case 
managers or house counselors if the patient lives in a group home), or should 
suggest temporary hospitalization. The threat of imminent suicide is not the 
time for confidentiality. If the patient is willing, she can be referred to area 
emergency services, such as emergency rooms. The rule of thumb is to select 
the least intrusive intervention necessary. 
Risk Factors and Operant versus Respondent Behavior. Two factors are 
important to keep in mind when planning treatment and deciding on how 
aaive to be in response to a suicidal crisis. The first factor is the short-term 
risk of suicide if the therapist does not actively intervene. The second factor 
is the long-term risk of suicide, or a life not worth living, if the therapist does 
actively intervene. The response to the patient in any given case requires a 
good knowledge of current risk factors and of the functions of suicidal be­
havior for this patient. Therapist will know much less clear about risk fac­
tors and the funaions of suicidal behavior for new patients; thus, in the early 
stages of therapy, treatment should be much more conservative and active. 
Risk faaors have been described above. The general rule is that the higher 
the risk, the more active the response should be; mitigating this, however, 
are the funaions of the behavior and the likely long-term consequences of 
various courses of action. Although in the short run a certain response may 
decrease the probability of suicide, the same response may actually increase 
the likelihood of future suicide. The key analysis that must be made is whether 
in the specific instance, the patient's suicide ideation, preparations, and com­
munications are operant or respondent behaviors. A behavior is respondent 
when it is automatically elicited by a situation or specific stimulus event; the 
behavior is under the control of the preceding events, not of the consequences. 
Suicide ideation and threats elicited by extreme hopelessness and a wish to 
die, by "voices" telling her to kill herself, or by severe depression, are exam­
ples here. When suicidal behavior is respondent, therapists do not have to 
be as wary that they will accidentally reinforce it by intervening. 
When the behavior is operant, it is under the control of the consequences. 
Operant behaviors function to affect the environment. When suicide idea­
tion and threats function to get others actively involved (e.g., to get help, to 
command attention or concern, to get others to solve problems, to obtain 
admission to a hospital, etc.), they are functionally operant. In these cases 
therapists have to be very wary of inadvertentiy reinforcing the very be­
haviors-high-risk suiddai behaviors-they are trying to stop. The difficulty 
is that if a therapist withholds active involvement, a patient can always esca­
late her behavior to a point where the therapist does intervene. This can rein-
--- Page 506 ---
Special Treatment Strategies 487 
force more lethal behavior than was happening previously. As such escala­
tion continues, suicidal behavior can become lethal. 
Much of the time, suiddai behaviors among borderline patients are simul­
taneously respondent and operant. Hopelessness, despair, and the unbeara-
bleness of life elicit the behavior The community's responses—giving help, 
taking the person seriously, taking the person out of difficuh situations, and 
so on—reinforce the behavior The best response is one that both reduces 
the eliciting faaors and minimally reinforces the behavior Unless there is a 
medical emergency, an aaive intervention that is potentially reinforcing should 
both require some improved patient behavior first and keep the patient safe. 
FlexibUity of response options is essential. The therapist must figure out 
the funaion of the behavior and then be active, but not in a manner that 
keeps the behavior funaional. There are many ways to keep a patient safe. 
For example, if the behavior functions to get the therapist's time and atten­
tion, and if going into the hospital is aversive for that patient, insisting that 
the problem is obviously so serious that she must get to the hospital right 
away maintains safety without reinforcement. Of course, the therapist should 
not give her extra time once she is in the hospital. When the funaional value 
of the behavior is to get the patient into a hospital, then the response should, 
of course, be different. Here the therapist may need to give the patient far 
more attention and aaive support outside of the hospital, or line up suffi­
cient community resources to keep her safe outside of a hospital. Or perhaps 
involuntary hospitalization should be considered (assuming that this is not 
a reinforcing option). It is always a good idea to have area hospitals ordered 
in terms of the patient's preference. A patient who becomes suicidal to gain 
admission should be admitted to her least preferred place, if possible. 
Complicating matters further, however, is the fact the therapist must 
remember that the objea is to remove consequences that actually reinforce 
suiddai behavior for the particular patient. As the reader may remember from 
Chapter 10, what is and is not reinforcing or punishing for a particular pa­
tient can only be determined by close empirical observation. The fact that 
a patient doesn't like a consequence, or even that she complains bitterly about 
it, does not necessarily mean that the consequence is not a reinforcer nonethe­
less. The necessity of having some idea of what consequences are maintain­
ing the patient's suiddai behaviors is the principal reason behind the emphasis 
in DBT on minute behavioral assessment of every episode of parasuicide and 
suicide crisis behavior. 
In summary, for operant suiddai behavior, the plan is to design a response 
that is natural instead of arbitrary, somewhat aversive (but not so aversive 
that it only temporarily suppresses the behavior or drives it into secrecy), and 
is not a reinforcer for that particular patient. Usually, but not always, this 
means seleaing something other than the patient's preferred therapeutic 
response. For respondent suicidal behavior, the plan is to design a therapeu­
tic response that stops (or at least reduces) the eliciting events, teaches the 
patient how to prevent them in the future, and reinforces altemative problem-

488 STRATEGIES FOR SPECIFIC TASKS 
solving behaviors. For combined operant and respondent suicidal behaviors, 
the strategies should be combined. 
Two points are important here. First, the decision as to whether suicidal 
behavior is operant or respondent should be based on careful assessment. 
Theory cannot answer this question; only close observation can. Second, in 
working with chronicaUy suicidal individuals, there will be times when 
reasonably high short-term risks must be taken to produce long-term benefits. 
It is very difficult to feel secure when a patient is direaly or indirealy threaten­
ing suicide. Difficulty in finding the best response is most likely when suici­
dal behavior is both respondent and operant and has previously been on an 
intermittent reinforcement schedule. The risks required in these cases are what 
make DBT somewhat like playing the car game of "chicken." In that game, 
two car drivers speed toward an obstacle; the objea is to be the last to swerve 
the car to safety. 
Generally, aaive intervention is taken to prevent suicide but not to pre­
vent parasuicide, unless there is reason to believe that the parasuicidal aa 
will result in serious medical harm. Ordinarily, burning, cutting, ingesting a 
few more drugs than recommended, or similar aas are not cause for environ­
mental intervention by the therapist. The choice here is between a consultation-
to-the-patient approach and an environmental intervention approach; the ther­
apist ordinarily chooses the former With a chronically parasuicidal patient, 
the therapist can expea a number of repeated parasuiddes before the behavior 
comes under control. However, it is ultimately essential that the behavior come 
under the patient's control, not the therapist's or the community's. 
Involuntary Intervention. Guidelines on when and how to hospitalize 
patients, including suicidal patients, are given in connection with ancillary 
treatment strategies (see below). DBT does not have a specific policy regard­
ing involuntary commitment of individuals at risk for suicide. Some therapists 
are more willing than others to use this option; opinions differ as to its ethics 
and efficacy. The important point in DBT is that therapists absolutely must 
know where they stand on this issue before patients become suicidal. The 
middle of a suicide crisis is no time to be figuring this out. Also, therapists 
must know the applicable legal guidelines, procedures, and legal precedents 
in their own state for involuntary commitment. 
It is important to be direa and clear about the reasons for interventions 
against the wishes of the patient. Often a therapist is acting in his or her own 
best interest (because of fear or exhaustion), and not necessarily the interest 
of the patient. In any case, when intervention is involuntary the therapist's 
and the patient's view of her interests conflia. Fortunately or unfortunately, 
when a person threatens suicide in a credible manner, in our legal system he 
or she gives up power to mental health professionals and loses individual rights 
of freedom. This is in spite of the fact that there is no empirical evidence 
whatsoever that involuntary intervention or psychiatric hospitalization actu­
ally decreases suicide risk in any way. 
--- Page 508 ---
Special Treatment Strategies 489 
In cases when the therapist's self-interest is at issue, observing limits and 
reciprocal communication can be used to indicate this to the patient. For ex­
ample, a therapist may involuntarily commit a suicidal patient to avoid the 
threat of being sued or held liable if the patient commits suicide. The ther­
apist may be aware that hospitalizing reinforces the behavior, but may be afraid 
to take the risk of suicide if the patient is not hospitalized. Some therapists 
are wiUing to take many fewer personal risks than others. Not all aaive in­
terventions must be justified as designed to protea the welfare of the patient, 
independent of the therapist's own welfare. If the patient has frightened the 
therapist, this should be made clear, and the therapist's right to maintain a 
comfortable existence should be explained. When the therapist's self-interest 
is not at issue—usually, when suidde risk appears very high and the individual 
does not seem capable of aaing in her own best interest—this should be made 
clear also. For example, although I am generally opposed to involuntary com­
mitment as a method of suicide prevention, I would not hesitate to commit 
an aaively suicidal individual in the middle of a psychotic episode. An im­
portant focus in working a with suicidal patient is on helping the patient ap­
preciate the motivations of individuals in the community who must respond 
to her suicidal behavior 
The therapist's position on involuntary commitment and probable 
response to threats of imminent suicide should be made very clear to the pa­
tient at the beginning of therapy. I teU my patients that if they ever convince 
me that they are going to commit suicide, I will probably aaively intervene 
to stop them. Although I believe in the individual's right of self-determination 
(including the rights of a borderline patient in therapy), I have no intention 
of having my professional life and treatment program threatened by a lawsuit 
because of a patient's committing suicide when I could have stopped it. I go 
on to express my personal phUosophy against involuntary commitment, but 
make it clear that I may violate that if necessary. I explain that in the final an­
alysis, if there is an irresolvable conflia between a patient's rights to engage 
in a certain behavior (suicide) and to remain free from involuntary confine­
ment versus my rights to maintain a professional practice and a treatment pro­
gram for other persons struggling with issues of life and death, I will most 
likely put my rights first. Although the communication style is irreverent, the 
therapeutic point is unportant. Suidde caimot be divorced from its interperson­
al context; by entering therapy, the patient is entering into an interpersonal 
relationship where her behavior wiU have consequences within the relationship. 
The same is true, of course, for the therapist's behavior, and the patient's view 
on voluntary commitment and right to choose suicide should also be explored. 
7. ANTICIPATING A RECURRENCE OF THE SUICIDAL URGES 
Once the patient is no longer threatening imminent suicide, the therapist 
should anticipate and plan for a recurrence of suicidal urges or urges to in-
flia self-injury. 
--- Page 509 ---
490 STRATEGIES FOR SPECIFIC TASKS 
8. LIMITING CONFIDENTIALITY 
The patient who threatens suicide or engages in potentiaUy lethal suicidal 
behaviors often requests that the therapist keep such behavior confidential. 
The therapist should not agree to this. This point should be made very clear­
ly to the patient and her family during the therapy orientation phase. 
ONGOING PARASUICIDAL ACT: 
PROTOCOL FOR THE PRIMARY THERAPIST 
I. ASSESSING AND RESPONDING TO EMERGENCIES 
If a patient phones her therapist after initiating self-injurious behavior, or 
if such behavior is initiated on the phone, the therapist should immediately 
focus the conversation on assessing the potential lethality of the behavior and 
obtaining the patient's current address and phone number. In the case of a 
drug overdose, the crisis planning sheet should be used to determine the poten­
tial lethality of the behavior for that particular patient. If the patient is cut­
ting herself, the therapist should ascertain the amount of blood and whether 
the cut appears to need medical attention. If the patient has turned on the 
gas in her house, the degree of ventilation and time that the gas was turned 
on should be ascertained. If the patient is ingesting chemical substances (e.g., 
drano, bleach), the type and amount should be determined. 
If the self-injurious behavior is possibly life-threatening, the immediacy 
of the medical danger should be assessed, along with the patient's ability to 
obtain medical treatment on her own and the presence of other people with 
her If the risk constitutes a medical emergency, the therapist should both 
attempt to alert any individuals currently near the patient and immediately 
call the appropriate community emergency services, giving them the location 
of the patient and information about the patient's parasuicidal behavior (This 
potential necessity requires that all therapists have patient's phone numbers 
and addresses always available.) The therapist should then call the patient 
back and stay in contact until aid arrives. If medical attention is required, 
but time is not of the essence, the therapist should first assess whether the 
patient is wUling to get the required attention voluntarily; if so, he or she 
should help the patient figure out how to get to the physician, medical clinic, 
or emergency room. Depending on the patient's condition and her circum­
stances, people in her environment should be recruited for transportation or 
the patient should be sent on her own or in a cab. Depending on the ther­
apist's trust in the patient, it may also be wise to instruct the patient to call 
and check in from the emergency room. This conversation, however, should 
be limited to checking on treatment and medical status. 
Patients are often unwiUing to get medical attention for a parasuicide, 
fearing (often reasonably) that ft wUl resuft in involuntary psychiatric hospitali­
zation. The therapist should apply problem-solving strategies here. If ft is med­
ically indicated (or sometimes if the therapist simply fears that it might be), 
--- Page 510 ---
Special Treatment Strategies 491 
not getting at least a medical examination should simply not be one of the 
options. The therapeutic relationship is the therapist's chief ally at this point. 
Unless the patient is at high risk of kUling herself if she is not hospitalized 
(or, of course, needs continuing medical attention), the DBT therapist does 
not recommend hospitalization following a parasuicide episode. In our clin­
ic, patients are instructed to tell the emergency room staff that they are in 
our treatment program and that hospitalization is not part of the treatment 
plan. The idea is for a patient to use all of her interpersonal skUls. If the phy­
sician or mental health professionals are not persuaded, they can be asked 
to call the therapist. The therapist can then verify the patient's description 
of the treatment program. At times, members of the emergency room staff 
wUl be quite fearful themselves of liability if the patient is not hospftalized. 
I have been asked more than once to agree to take clinical responsibility for 
a patient if she is released. This can be a difficult situation for any therapist, 
since it generally occurs by phone rather than in the patient's presence. How 
the therapist responds should depend on his or her knowledge of the patient 
and the patient's current risk status. How the therapist responds, however, 
can also be very important to the therapeutic relationship. 
For example, one of my patients who was new in therapy took a moder­
ately serious overdose of several medications. Her mother called me, and I 
sent both to the emergency room. From there the patient called me, begging 
me to talk to the physician, who was threatening to arrange involuntary com­
mitment to the psychiatric unit. Although the patient was clearly out of med­
ical danger, the physician believed that anyone who overdosed should be 
hospitalized for the night. He insisted that I agree to take all clinical respon­
sibility for the patient if he discharged her In talking to the patient, I pointed 
out to her that I was putting myself on the line for her, and quizzed her on 
her commitment to avoid further suicidal behavior and her wUlingness and 
abUity to carry through on such a commitment. After coaching her on ap­
propriate emergency room behavior and verifying our next appointment, I 
told the physician that I would accept responsibility for her continued care 
if he discharged her. It was a very difficult aa of trust on my part, but one 
that I thought the patient needed. Most of the time, however, the patient's 
interpersonal skills (perhaps with a lot of coaching) will be sufficient; the 
therapist's best strategy is then to recommend that emergency room person­
nel, paramedics, or police officers on the scene carry out normal procedures. 
Although the overriding concern in such a medical crisis is to keep the 
patient alive, two secondary issues are important in the long-range manage­
ment of suicidal individual. First, therapists should work with community 
agents in developing general crisis response strategies that are minimally rein­
forcing of suicidal behavior Second, the social consequences of serious sui­
cidal behavior should not be interfered with. The therapist should constantly 
reiterate to the patient that he or she has no control over community agen­
cies. Thus, the patient can develop reaHstic expeaations about likely com­
munity responses to her suicidal behavior 
--- Page 511 ---
492 STRATEGIES FOR SPECIFIC TASKS 
The suicidal patient will quickly appreciate the differences between the 
DBT therapist's and the community's responses to suicidal behavior Gener­
ally, community agencies wiU respond far more aaively than the DBT ther­
apist. In these instances, the therapist should discuss matter-of-faaly wfth 
the patient the effect of her engaging in behavior that frightens other in­
dividuals. 
2. KEEPING THE 24-HOUR RULE 
If the self-injurious behavior is clearly not now or potentially life-threatening 
or dangerous, the therapist should revert to the 24-hour rule, which is 
described more fully later in connection with the telephone strategies. The 
therapist should remind the patient that calling after engaging in self-injurious 
behavior is not appropriate, and should instma her to contaa other resources 
(family, friends, emergency services). Except in very unusual circumstances, 
the conversation should then be terminated. The inappropriate call as well 
as the parasuicideal behavior should be discussed in the next therapy session. 
SUICIDAL BEHAVIORS: PROTOCOL 
FOR COLLATERAL THERAPISTS 
1. KEEPING THE PATIENT SAFE 
If the patient engages in behaviors that suggest high imminent risk for sui­
cide, all therapists attend to the behavior All therapists other than the primary 
therapist should do what is necessary to keep the patient safe (see above) un­
til contact can be made with the primary therapist. 
2. REFERRING TO THE PRIMARY THERAPIST 
Once safety is assured, contacting the primary therapist is the first response. 
All therapists make it clear to the patient that help with the suicidal crisis, 
even if the patient feels that a collateral therapist is the source of the crisis, 
must be obtained from the primary therapist. Skills trainers may help the pa­
tient use distress tolerance skiUs untU such contaa can be made; pharmacother­
apists may adjust medications (e.g., give a hypnotic to a patient with insomnia) 
to increase her tolerance; and so on. But, other than attending to safety is­
sues and observing their own limits with respect to the amount of suicide 
risk they are willing to tolerate, all therapists except the primary therapist 
respond to suicide crisis behaviors by referral. The primary therapist responds 
with relevant problem-solving strategies discussed above. 
Exceptions: Skills Training and Supportive Process Groups. One rule 
in skills training and supportive process groups is that parasuicidal acts can­
not be discussed with other patients outside of group meetings. If the topic 
is brought up in a group session, attention is immediately focused on how 
--- Page 512 ---
Special Treatment Strategies 493 
the behavior could have been avoided or could be avoided in the future (i.e., 
to other solutions). In a group, the therapist direas attention in a very matter-
of-faa manner to how DBT or other behavioral skills could be applied in 
such instances. A simUar approach is used when suidde ideation and urges 
are discussed. Displays of parasuicidal sequelae, (e.g., bandaged arms, un­
covered cuts) or discussions of outcomes (e.g., being hospitalized) are gener­
ally ignored. The only behavior direaly attended to is an attempt to engage 
in parasuicide during a therapy session; the individual is told to stop and, 
if necessary, the behavior is prevented. If the behavior persists, the primary 
therapist is called for instruaions or the patient is asked to leave. (Of course, 
if there is high medical or suicide risk, safety is the first concern.) 
Exceptions: Inpatient and Day Treatment. Inpatient and day treatment 
environments offer unique possibilities for enhancing the application of 
problem-solving sttategies to suiddai behaviors, because of the increased num­
ber of individuals who can respond to such behaviors in a focused, problem-
solving manner 
For example, in one inpatient setting, the nursing staff and/or mental 
health technicians condua immediate, in-depth behavioral and solution ana­
lyses of aU parasuicidal or suicide crisis behaviors. The analyses are then 
repeated during the weekly community meeting where patient and staff in­
teraaions are reviewed. The key to the success of this public procedure is con­
duaing of the analyses in a nonjudgmental, matter-of-faa, and validating 
manner Staff members must provide an exposure atmosphere that does not 
further reinforce the shame, guilt, and fear patient's feel about admitting and 
discussing the behavior. Thus, not only are behavioral and solution analyses 
modeled for the patients, but they have a chance to participate in the con­
dua of these analyses (presumably inaeasing their skiU), and also may benefit 
from the vicarious exposure and contengendes applied. Finally, the behavioral 
and solution analyses, together with other problem-solving strategies, are also 
applied by the individual therapist. 
In another setting, patients were formerly put on public, constant ob­
servation following parasuicidal or suicide crisis behaviors. With minor ex­
ceptions, a patient was not allowed to talk to anyone during the 24 hours 
following such a behavior. The procedure was modified in accord with DBT 
prindples to drop the enforced silence. The new rule was that for the 24 hours 
foUowing a parasuicidal or suicide crisis behavior, the only topics of conver­
sation allowed with staff or other patients would be formal behavioral and 
solution analyses of the behavior In each of these protocols, suicidal behaviors 
and their attendant pain are taken very seriously. 
Principles of Risk Management witii Suicidal Patients 
DBT as a whole was developed for the chronically suicidal, borderline pa­
tient. Thus, most modifications of "ordinary" psychotherapy to handle suici­
dal behaviors have been included within the fabric of the therapy. However, 
--- Page 513 ---

not all borderline patients present as being at high risk for suicide. For pa­
tients who do, or who become high-risk patients during the course of treat­
ment, the therapist should of course be particularly careful to employ strate­
gies that minimize the risk of such patients' suicide. The therapist should also, 
however, take steps to minimize the risk of his or her own legal liability if 
a patient does commit suicide. As Bongar (1991) and others have suggested, 
it is naive for the clinician not to consider appropriate clinical and legal is­
sues when treating high-risk populations. Bongar suggests a number of clini­
cal and legal risk management strategies that are or can be easily incorporated 
into DBT. These include the following: 
1. Self-assessment of technical and personal competence to treat suici­
dal behaviors is essential. Such competence should include knowledge of the 
specific clinical and research literature on recommended interventions for sui­
cidal behaviors, as well as for other disorders the patient presents with. Not 
all clinicians are cut out to work with suicidal patients, and certainly many 
are not equipped by temperament or by training to work with suicidal bor­
derline patients. A therapist should refer a patient or obtain supervision and 
additional training if his or her competence is not sufficient. 
2. Meticulous and timely documentation is required. The therapist 
should keep thorough records of suicide risk assessments; analyses of the risks 
and benefits of various treatment plans; treatment decisions and their ration­
ales (including decisions not to hospitalize a patient or not to take other 
precautions); consultations obtained and advice received; communications 
with the patient and with others about treatment plans and associated risks; 
and informed consents obtained. The general rule of thumb here is "What 
isn't written didn't happen." 
3. Previous medical and psychotherapy records should be obtained for 
each patient, especially as these relate to treatment for suicidal behaviors. In 
DBT, the optimal procedure here would be to make the patient responsible 
for obtaining these records and bringing them into therapy. 
4. Involving the family, and if necessary the patient's support system 
(with the permission of the patient), in management and treatment of suici­
dal risk; informing family members of risks and benefits of proposed treat­
ment versus alternative treatments; and actively seeking the family's support 
for keeping the patient engaged in treatment can be very useful. This is all 
compatible with DBT when the patient is seen jointiy with the family or sup­
port network, and it is often recommended by suicide experts. 
5. Consultation with other professionals about general management and 
risk assessment is a definitional part of DBT and is also a part of standard 
treatment of suicidal behaviors. The nonmedical clinician should consult spe­
cifically with medical colleagues about the advisability of using medication 
or the need for additional medical evaluation. Ancillary pharmacotherapy is 
compatible with DBT and may be useful in the individual case. 
6. Postvention following a patient's suicide-including addressing per-

sonal and legal issues, counseling with other staff members involved in the 
patient's care, and meeting and working with famUy and friends—can be ex-
ttemely difficuh, but is nonetheless essential. Consultation with a knowledge­
able coUeague about postvention steps, including legal consultations, is 
strongly recommended by many. 
THERAPY-INTERFERING BEHAVIOR STRATEGIES 
As I have emphasized throughout this volume, DBT requires aaive, coUabora­
tive participation on the part of the patient. There are three main types of 
patient therapy-interfering behaviors: (1) behaviors that interfere with receiv­
ing therapy (nonattentive, noncollaborative, noncompliant behaviors); (2) 
patient-to-patient interfering behaviors; and (3) behaviors that bum out the 
therapist (i.e., behaviors that push the therapist's personal limits or decrease 
his or her motivation). Specific instances of these behaviors are discussed in 
Chapter 5. The overall strategy for dealing with patient therapy-interfering 
behavior is to approach it as a problem to be solved and to assume that the 
patient is motivated to solve her problems. (Special methods for dealing with 
therapist therapy-interfering behaviors are discussed below in conneaion with 
the relationship strategies.) 
As noted in Chapter 3, a borderline patient oscillates between two dis­
tina types of self-invalidation. On the one hand, she believes that aU of her 
behavioral faUures, including faUures within therapy, are at root motivation­
al problems and demonstrate that she is not trying hard enough, is lazy, or 
simply does not want to improve. On the other hand, she believes that all 
of these failures result from irremediable charaaer deficits. In contrast, the 
therapist assumes that the patient is trying, is doing her best, and is not fatal­
ly flawed, and makes clear statements to this effea when discusshig problemat­
ic behavior. Such an orientation prompts both therapist and patient to view 
interfering behavior as evidence of a problem in the treatment itself, rather 
than as evidence in support of negative conclusions about certain traits of 
the patient. The therapy-interfering behavior strategies are discussed below 
and outlined in Table 15.5. 
I. DEFINING THE INTERFERING BEHAVIOR 
The first step is to specify interfering behaviors as accurately and precisely 
as possible. The nature of the interfering behavior should be discussed with 
the patient and discrepandes m the patient's and therapist's perceptions should 
be resolved. 
2. CONDUCTING A CHAIN ANALYSIS OF THE BEHAVIOR 
The therapist should not begin an analysis by asking the patient why she did 
or did not engage in some spedfied behavior Instead, as for suiddai behaviors.

a chain analysis should specify the antecedents that produce the response, 
the response itself, and the consequences that follow the response, all in ex­
haustive detaU. When the patient has difficulty identifying or communicat­
ing variables influencing her interfering behavior, the therapist should generate 
hypotheses for discussion; these should be based on knowledge of the specif­
ic individual and of suicidal patients in general. A large variety of situations 
can produce interfering behavior, and each instance of such behavior must 
be approached ideographically. For example, one patient may miss therapy ses­
sions because she does not believe that they are helpful or feels hopeless about 
her chances of improvement. Another patient may miss sessions because of 
anticipatory anxiety, depression, or other negative feelings. A third patient 
may miss sessions because of the inability to produce the behaviors needed 
for session attendance (e.g., leaving work on time, arranging for babysitting, 
telling friends that she has to leave for an appointment). A fourth patient 
may miss sessions because of pressure in her environment. For example, peo­
ple in her family or those she lives with may pressure her to stop therapy, 
may ridicule her for going to therapy, or may otherwise punish session at­
tendance. 
3. ADOPTING A PROBLEM-SOLVING PLAN 
Once the problem is defined and the determinants identified, patient and ther­
apist must agree on a program for reducing the interfering behavior Such 
--- Page 516 ---
Special Treatment Strategies 497 
a program should be based on the results of the analysis of the interfering 
behavior A program may focus on motivational issues and changing contin-
gendes, teachuig skills necessary for performing the requisite behaviors, reduc­
ing inhibiting emotions, changing beliefs and expectancies, or manipulating 
environmental determinants. As with all problems in therapy, the therapist 
should verbaUy emphasize and model a problem-solving approach. 
4. RESPONDING TO THE PATIENT WHO 
REFUSES TO MODIFY INTERFERING BEHAVIOR 
At times, a borderline patient will simply refuse to comply with requirements 
of therapy. The patient may say that she does not need to attend so many 
sessions; may refuse to role-play or carry out homework assignments; may 
simply refuse to abide by other therapeutic agreements; may demand that the 
therapist cure her; or may say that it is the therapist's responsibUity to be 
helpful, which he or she is not. In these instances, the therapist should en­
gage the patient in a discussion of the overall goals of the treatment, as well 
as of the initial agreements that the patient endorsed upon entering therapy 
and that were conditions for her acceptance into the treatment program. As 
with many targets in DBT, the sttategy is to talk the problem behavior to death. 
The therapist should be very careful to avoid unnecessary power strug­
gles. If an issue does not seem important, it should not be pursued. Learning 
how to retreat is very important in DBT,as is choosing battles wisely. The 
therapist should be prepared, though, to fight and win some battles in order 
to help the patient. The patient should not be described as not caring or as 
being lazy, accused of intentionally sabotaging therapy or described the in 
any other pejorative language. 
If the patient simply refuses to go along with the therapy, the possibility 
of a vacation from therapy, or of a referral to another therapist, should be 
brought up for discussion. Such discussions should always stress that it is 
the patient who would be choosing to go on vacation or to terminate, not 
the therapist. Indeed, the therapist emphasizes firmly that he or she cares about 
the patient and hopes that they can work together to solve the current im­
passe. Such discussions should be carried out only when the patient refuses 
to work on resolving the problem and other less drastic options have been 
explored with both the patient and the supervision/consultation team. 
TELEPHONE STRATEGIES 
The DBT telephone strategies are designed with several points in mind. First, 
the overriding principle is that a patient should not be required to be suicidal 
in order to obtain extra time and attention from her primary therapist. Thus, 
the strategies are designed to minimize the therapist's phone contaa as a rein­
forcer for parasuicide and suicide ideation. Second, the strategies are designed 
to teach the patient how to apply the skills she is leaming in therapy to the 
--- Page 517 ---
498 STRATEGIES FOR SPECIFIC TASKS 
problem situations of her everyday life—in other words, to encourage skills 
generalization. 
Third, the phone strategies provide addhional therapy time to the pa­
tient between sessions when crises arise or the patient is otherwise unable 
to cope with problems in living. Suicidal and borderline patients frequently 
need more therapeutic contaa than can be provided in one individual ses­
sion per week, especially since individual patients' concems can rarely be dis­
cussed in skUls training sessions. Although extra therapy sessions may 
occasionally be scheduled, the need for more therapy time is usuaUy addressed 
via the therapist's availability to phone caUs from the patient. 
Fourth, the phone strategies are designed to provide training for the pa­
tient in how to request help from others appropriately. In DBT, the patient 
may call her primary therapist for assistance when necessary. Phone calls to 
coUateral therapists, including group therapists, are severely limited; calls can 
be made to obtain information about meeting times, to make appointments, 
or to resolve a problem that would lead to therapy termination otherwise. 
These conditions are discussed in the companion manual to this volume. 
Although patients' phone calls to their therapists occur on a continuum 
from "few or none" to "excessive," the calls of borderline patients often either 
faU at one end of the continuum or vacillate at different periods between one 
end and the other Some patients call their therapists at the least sign of trou­
ble, often calling at inappropriate times and interaaing with the therapists 
in a demanding and hostile manner. Other patients refuse to call their ther­
apists under any circumstances, with the possible exception of already in­
itiated or completed parasuicidal behavior It is often useful to make calling 
the therapist between sessions a homework assignment for this type of pa­
tient. Or a patient may, at different times in therapy, call either not often 
enough or too often. 
The application of the phone strategies will be somewhat different for 
the noncaUing patient versus the patient who calls excessively. Often the non-
calling patient must learn to ask for help earlier in the crisis sequence, so 
that suicidal behavior does not funaion to get attention. The excessive phone 
caller often needs to improve her distress tolerance skUls. There are three main 
types of telephone contact with the patient: (1) phone calls from the patient 
to the therapist because of a crisis or inability to solve a current problem in 
living, or because of a mpture in the therapeutic relationship; (2) preplanned 
regular phone caUs from the patient to the therapist; and (3) phone calls to 
the patient from the therapist. Strategies for each are discussed below and 
summarized in Table 15.6.

after; indeed, they do not have to be suicidal in order to call. As noted earlier 
in this chapter, once parasuicideal behavior has occurred, a patient is not al­
lowed to call her therapist for 24 hours afterward (unless her injuries are life-
threatening). The idea here is that a therapist can be more helpful before than 
after an attempt to solve problems via a parasuicidal aa. The rationale given 
is that a phone caU is no longer useful after a patient has engaged in self-
injurious behavior, because the patient has already solved the problem (al­
beit maladaptively) and now has little need for the therapist's attention. The 
role of therapist reinforcement in precipitating suicidal ideation should be 
clearly described to the patient. In addition, the therapist should clearly in­
dicate to the patient that it is extraordinarily difficult for anyone to be very 
helpful to a person who waits untU a crisis is fuU-blown before asking for help. 
Typically, a patient's existing behavior is to call after a parasuicidal act. 
These calls should be handled in the manner described earlier in this chap­
ter The goal is to shape the patient into calling the therapist at earlier stages 
of crisis. An intermediate step in this shaping might be calling before the 
parasuidde but after the suicide ideation is initiated; the final goal, of course, 
is calling before engaging in suicidal ideation. 
This strategy achieves different effeas, depending on the patient's will­
ingness to call the therapist. For a patient who finds calling the therapist aver­
sive, the strategy offers an opportunity for learning to replace destmctive 
behavior wfth asking for help appropriately. Parasuicidal behavior not pre­
ceded by an attempt to call the therapist is viewed as a therapy-interfering 
behavior, and thus becomes a focus of therapy time. For the patient who finds 
talking to the therapist comforting, by contrast, any behaviors associated with 
--- Page 519 ---
500 STRATEGIES FOR SPECIFIC TASKS 
a phone call will be reinforced. Thus the therapist has a choice of reinforcing 
adaptive behavior or suicidal behavior A call to the therapist is permitted 
following 24 hours of nonparasuicidal behavior; if the patient engages in 
parasuicide again in the first 24 hours, the clock starts again. Very occasion­
ally, this time frame can be reduced to 12 hours. The therapist must be care­
ful to provide the same sort of time and attention for less crisis-oriented 
moments as for peak suicidal periods. It is essential to instma the patient 
that she does not have to feel suicidal in order to call the therapist. 
Types of Calls 
CaUs to the therapist are encouraged under two conditions, and those condi­
tions determine the conduct of a call. The first condition is when the patient 
is in a crisis or is facing a problem she cannot solve on her own. The second 
condition is when the therapy relationship is in disrepair and mending is need­
ed. Generally, phone calls will last for no longer than 10 to 20 minutes, al­
though exceptions can be made in crisis situations. If a longer amount of 
time is needed, it may be useful for the therapist to schedule an extra session 
with the patient or suggest that the patient call the therapist again in a day 
or so. 
Focusing on Skills. The rationale of these calls (at least from the ther­
apist's viewpoint) is that the patient often needs help in applying the behavioral 
skills she has learned to date, or is learning, to problems or crises in daUy 
living. The focus of these calls should be applying skills—«of on analyzing 
the entire problem, analyzing the patient's response to the problem, or provid­
ing catharsis. The crises strategies described earlier should be implemented. 
With a relatively easy problem, the focus may be on skills for aaually resolv­
ing the problem. For more intransigent or complex problems, the focus may 
be on responding in a way that wUl enable the patient to get to the next ses­
sion without engaging in maladaptive behavior That is, dysfunctional be­
havior is averted, but the problem is not necessarily solved. It is essential to 
keep this in mind and to remind the patient of it. Problems often need to 
be tolerated for some time. Distress tolerance skills should be recommended. 
All patients and therapists should have readily available near the phone 
the crisis survival strategies (see the companion manual to this volume). Af­
ter getting a brief description of a patient's problem or crisis, the therapist 
should ask which skills the person has already tried (either ones she is learn­
ing in DBT or other skUls she has developed independentiy). Then the ther­
apist should review other DBT skills that might help or other ideas the patient 
has. I may ask the patient to try one or two more skUlful responses and then 
call me back to check in; at that point, we can figure out a new response 
if that is needed. 
The trap to avoid is conducting DBT individual psychotherapy over the 
phone. This can be difficult because the patient often presents a crisis as ir-
--- Page 520 ---
Special Treatment Strategies 501 
reparable or may be so emotionaUy aroused that her problem-solving skills 
are compromised. Rigid thinking and inability to see new solutions are com­
mon. The therapist should respond to this in three ways. First, the aisis strate­
gies described earlier in this chapter should be used as appropriate. Second, 
the focus should be kept on what skills the person can use; the therapist is 
responsible for keeping the call on track. Third, aU problem-solving efforts 
should be interwoven with validation of the patient's misery and difficulty. 
Persistent "Yes, but. . ." behavior is therapy-interfering and should be ana­
lyzed (at the next session) if common. Within a phone caU, the therapist should 
respond to such behavior with reciprocal communication, disclosing the ef­
fea of that behavior on his or her willingness to continue. 
Over time, if the therapist persists with this strategy, both the patient's 
skills in everyday life and her skills in obtaining help on the phone should 
improve. The frequency and duration of calls wiU decrease. As several of our 
clinic patients have said after some time and a large reduction in phone calls, 
after a while they know exaaly what we are going to do and say, and they 
can just as well do and say it themselves. Or, as one patient said, "Talking 
about skills all the time is not much fun." 
Repairing the Relationship. If there is a rupture in the therapeutic rela­
tionship, I have not thought it reasonable to require the patient to wait up to 
a whole week before it can be repaired. Such a rule is arbitrary and seems to 
me lacking in compassion. Thus, when the relationship is in disrepair and the 
patient feels alienated, it is appropriate for her to call for a brief "heart-to-
heart"-that is, to process her feelings about the therapist and the therapist's 
treatment of her Usually these calls wdU be predpitated by intense anger, fears 
of abandonment, or feelings of rejeaion. It is also appropriate for the pa­
tient to call just to "check in." The therapist's role in these calls is to soothe 
and reassure (except in the final phase of treatment, when the focus is on the 
patient's learning to soothe herself). In-depth analysis should wait until the 
next session; however, without the phone call, there might not be a next 
session. 
Some therapists are afraid that if they aUow patients to call them when 
the relationship is ruptured, this will inadvertently reinforce ruptures, and 
the therapy relationship will graduaUy worsen. This is a likely outcome if two 
conditions are met: (1) Talking to a therapist on the phone is more reinforc­
ing than avoiding ruptures and alienation, and (2) phone calls become paired 
with relationship-mpturing responses. The solution here is twofold. First, the 
therapist should break the rupture-reinforcement link by making sure that 
the patient is free to caU for brief "check-ins" when there is no relationship 
mpture. For example, the phone scheduling described in the next seaion can 
be used; this can be particularly important for a patient who finds ft difficult 
to go an entire week with no contaa. Second, the therapist should try to make 
a relationship with no mptures and no relationship caUs more reinfordng than 
a relationship with mptures plus caUs. Steps in this dfteaion indude systematic 
--- Page 521 ---
502 STRATEGIES FOR SPECIFIC TASKS 
behavioral analysis and problem solving in subsequent therapy sessions of 
events that lead to excessive phone calls. In addition, the therapist should 
not give the patient more control over therapy or more validation, praise, or 
other social reinforcement only when the relationship is not going weU. The 
therapist must pay attention to the contingencies provided when the relation­
ship is going well. Social reinforcement should not be faded too quickly. 
2. SCHEDULING PATIENT-INITIATED PHONE CALLS 
At times, the patient may need more time and attention on a regular basis 
than the therapist can provide in the weekly individual session. For example, 
the patient may be calling three or more times per week on a continuing ba­
sis. In such instances, the therapist should consider scheduling caUs for preset, 
regular intervals. Such a policy recognizes the patient's need for greater as­
sistance; minimizes the positive consequences for being in a crisis; and, by 
inserting a waiting period between calls, requires the patient to develop greater 
distress tolerance skills. Although the patient receives more therapist time, 
the extra time is not temporally contingent on the patient's feeling panicked 
or in a state of crisis. In essence, this strategy is simUar to giving medical pa­
tients regular pain cocktails noncontingently rather than making them con­
tingent upon the presence of pain. If regular phone sessions are scheduled, 
the therapist should resist the temptation to talk with the patient at an unsche­
duled time, even if a crisis is present. 
3. INITIATING THERAPIST PHONE CONTACTS 
Therapist-initiated phone calls are designed to further extinguish any func­
tional conneaion between the therapist's attention and the patient's suicidal 
behavior and intense negative affea. Such caUs should be independent of 
patient-initiated calls to the therapist, although generaUy they wUl only be 
planned when it is known that the patient is having an unusually difficuh 
time or is facing a very stressful event. These phone calls can be quite brief 
and should focus on how the patient is doing in applying therapeutic princi­
ples to her current daUy problems. 
A second time for therapist-initiated phone contact is when the patient 
is trying to avoid therapy or work on a problem; in these cases, the phone 
call breaks up the avoidance. For example, if a patient is afraid of coming to 
therapy and does not show up, I may caU right away and be rather direaive 
about figuring out a way for her to get to the session while time stUl remains 
or scheduling her for later in the day Once again, the therapist must analyze 
the function of the patient's maladaptive behaviors and respond accordingly 
4. GIVING FEEDBACK ABOUT PHONE 
CALL BEHAVIOR DURING SESSIONS 
As noted previously, one goal of the telephone strategies is to help the patient 
learn how to ask other individuals for help appropriately. Help-seeking be-
--- Page 522 ---
Special Treatment Strategies 503 
havior requires the individual to be socially sensitive, so that she does not 
ask for help excessively or at inappropriate times. In addftion, the request 
must be neither made in a demanding manner nor presented in such a fashion 
that the recipient is not aaually able to help. Thus it is essential to give the 
patient feedback about both her behavior in asking for help and, when ap­
propriate, the responses these requests have elicited in the therapist. 
A major tteatment goal ui DBT is to help the patient find other individuals 
in her environment to turn to for help. However, it must be recognized that 
if the patient's skUls are not at a reasonable level, asking others for help may 
lead to increased isolation rather than increased social networking. On the 
other hand, the therapist must be alert to fostering too much dependency 
on the part of the patient. 
This is a spedal problem when treatment is time-limited. No matter how 
inept the patient is at asking for help, at the end of the time limit she will 
be required to ask others rather than the therapist for needed assistance. By 
at least the midpoint of therapy, the therapist should be aaively working with 
the patient on finding other individuals in her environment for her to call 
when she is having problems in living. If these calls do not produce positive 
results, they should be discussed and analyzed within the therapy sessions. 
Strategies for improving the results should be planned and practiced by the 
patient. 
Therapist Availability and Management of Suicidal Risk 
When I condua workshops with therapists, one of the most persistent fears 
raised is that of being called too frequently after work hours by borderline 
patients. Many therapists feel overwhelmed and unable to limit what feel to 
them like intrusions in their everyday lives. Some therapists cope with this 
by developing arbitrary rules limiting phone caUs at home. Others cope by 
using an answering service or machine as a go-between, instruaing the serv­
ice to tell patients that they are unavailable or having the machine do so when 
they do not wish to be disturbed. Others cope by getting so angry at their 
patients that they quickly learn not to call. Still others simply refuse to see 
suicidal and/or borderline patients. The DBT observing-Iimits procedures, 
together with the therapy-interfering behavior strategies, are designed to give 
therapists some control over the potentially unmanageable phone calls of their 
patients. 
The tension between a therapist's wishes and needs and a patient's wishes 
and needs, however, can be very real and potentially very serious. There will 
be times when a therapist must extend his or her limits, sometimes for fairly 
long periods of time, and be available to a patient by phone and during the 
evenmg hours. I beHeve strongly, as do a number of experts (see Bongar, 1991) 
in the treatment of suicidal patients (including those who meet criteria for 
BPD) must be told that they can call their therapists at any time—night or 
day, work days or holidays if necessary. A high risk suicidal patient must 
--- Page 523 ---
504 STRATEGIES FOR SPECIFIC TASKS 
be given a phone number where she can reach her therapist at home. If an 
answering service is used, it must be instructed to contaa the therapist for 
calls from suicidal patients unless very special circumstances require therapists 
to limit access. If access is Hmited, a therapist must provide access to other 
backup professional care. 
With my own patients, for example, I tell them that whenever they caU 
me and I am unavailable, they can be assured that, at the latest, I wUl call 
them back before I go to bed that night. If they cannot wait, they have back­
up phone numbers they can call. (I have also spent countless hours with ac­
tively parasuicidal patients discussing alternate solutions they could have 
employed to cope with their crises and/or rage at not getting me on the phone 
immediately.) When a patient is in a suicidal crisis, I may give her my daily 
schedule, letting her know when she can most easily get me by phone. I may 
plan periodic calls to be sure we connect. When I am out of town, I either 
give patients my phone numbers or am available for emergency contaa through 
my phone service; the skills training leaders also provide backup coverage. 
Thus, continuity of care is assured. I have never had access to me abused when 
I am out of town, but knowing that I can be reached is very soothing for 
many patients. 
In my experience, very few DBT patients actually abuse their ability to 
telephone their therapists when DBT strategies are used consistently. For those 
who do, inappropriate calling simply becomes a therapy-interfering behavior 
to work on in sessions. If it is discussed every single time a patient abuses 
the phone, the behavior will not continue long. It is essential, of course, that 
the therapist not view all (or most) calls during a crisis or calls for help in 
averting a crisis as abusive or manipulative. 
ANCILLARY TREATMENT STRATEGIES 
I. RECOMMENDING ANCILLARY TREATMENT WHEN NEEDED 
There is nothing in DBT that proscribes ancillary mental health treatments, 
as long as these programs are clearly ancillary to DBT and not the primary 
treatments. Outpatients may be admitted for brief psychiatric inpatient visits 
or residential substance abuse programs (as long as they do not miss more 
than 4 scheduled weeks of DBT); take psychotropic medications and see a 
physician, nurse, or other pharmacotherapist for monitoring; participate in 
behavioral skills classes offered in the community; attend group meetings and 
meet with their counselors in residential treatment communities; see case 
managers associated with ancUlary treatment; go to marriage counseling, voca­
tional counseling, or movement therapy; and attend day treatment. Patients 
are likely to make occasional contact with other mental health care providers 
(e.g., crisis clinics and emergency rooms). In my experience, any attempt at 
proscribing andllary treatment for borderiine patients would lead to efther 
dishonesty by the patients or open rebellion. Thus, in the usual treatment 
situation with a borderiine patient, the mental heafth network is often large

The ancUlary treatment strategies are outlined in Table 15.7. 
The chances that the patient will be admitted to an inpatient psychiatric 
unit and take psychotropic medications are so great that special DBT hospi­
tal and medication protocols have been developed and are discussed below. 
With all ancillary treatments, the case management strategies, especially the 
consultation-to-the-patient strategies discussed in Chapter 13, should be ap­
plied. When interacting with ancillary treatment professionals and with the 
patient in regard to these professionals, the therapist must remember that his 
or her role is that of consultant to the patient, not consultant to the ancillary 
treatment unit. It is useful to remember the DBT dialectical strategies, espe­
cially the emphasis on truth as constmaed rather than absolute and the prin-
dple that consistency need not be maintained. If the patient receives confliaing 
advice, opinions, or interpretations, the primary therapist can assist the pa­
tient in thinking through how she herself wants to consider herself and her 
own life and problems. 
2. RECOMMENDING OUTSIDE 
CONSULTATION FOR THE PATIENT 
The primary therapist should be very free in recommending that the patient 
obtain outside consultation when she is unhappy with the individual therapy

or with her relationship with the primary therapist or the treatment team. 
One of the inequities in DBT is that the therapist has a helper team in his 
or her relationship with the patient, but the patient may not have a similarly 
competent team to help her in relating to the therapist. The inequity is miti­
gated somewhat by group therapy, where group members and leaders assist 
patients in their episodic traumas with individual therapists. Not only is find­
ing other consultation viewed as desirable, but the therapist should be will-
--- Page 526 ---
Special Treatment Strategies 507 
ing to assist the patient in finding such help. As I discuss below, psychiatric 
inpatient staff members can often be extremely useful here. 
A patient should not participate in more than one individually oriented 
psychotherapy relationship at a time. That is, there can only be one primary 
therapist at a time. Within DBT, all therapists other than the individual psy­
chotherapist are clearly complementary to the individual psychotherapist; the 
same relationship must obtain with outside professionals. Within the con­
text of DBT, seeing an outside individual consultant is aUowed for up to three 
sessions in close succession. More than that should be considered being in 
dual therapy. This is considered a form of therapy-interfering behavior and 
is thus high in priority for session focus. 
MEDICATION PROTOCOL 
PROTOCOL WHEN PHARMACOTHERAPISTS 
ARE ANCILLARY PROFESSIONALS 
I. SEPARATING PHARMACOTHERAPY FROM PSYCHOTHERAPY. In 
standard DBT, the primary therapist does not supervise, manage, or prescribe 
psychotropic medications. With the exceptions discussed below, this strategy 
holds even when the primary therapist is a physician or nurse-praaitioner 
The approach was derived both from our clinical experiences in trying to com­
bine pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy, and from behavioral principles un­
derlying the teaching of patients to be responsible and competent medical 
consumers. My clinical experiences suggested that patients were often dis­
honest about their use of medications. As one patient told me, if I proscribed 
certain medications she wanted, she would just get them somewhere else and 
not tell me about it. It became clear that if a patient's primary therapist has 
the role of medication manager, the patient has an incentive to lie about medi­
cation abuse as a means of obtaining more drugs from the therapist. From 
a behavioral point of view, this renders the therapist almost totally ineffec­
tive in the role of teacher of proper use of medications and medical consulta­
tion. Essentially, the therapist is in the power position of drug prescriber, and 
such a role interferes with his or her ability to work collaboratively with the 
patient regarding the proper use of medications. 
In the years since I instituted the policy of separating psychotherapy from 
pharmacotherapy in my treatment program, we have discovered a troubling 
tendency on the part of patients to overuse, underuse, and generally misuse 
prescribed medications; combine medications in idiosyncratic ways; hoard 
medications for a possible future suicide attempt or in case medical benefits 
are cut off; and interact with the prescribing psychiatrist or nurse in an in­
effeaive manner at times and a dissembling manner at other times. I am not 
sure whether this tendency is any greater in suicidal and borderline patients 
than it is in any other patient population. However, it was clear in our clinic 
that we learned a lot more about these praaices as soon as we separated the 
two types of therapy. 
--- Page 527 ---
508 STRATEGIES FOR SPECIFIC TASKS 
2. CONSULTING TO THE PATIENT ON PHARMACOTHERAPY CON­
SUMER ISSUES. Once the two roles are separated, the psychotherapist be­
comes the consultant to the patient about how to interact effeaively with 
medical personnel; how to communicate what her needs are in a way that 
can be heard and responded to; how to obtain the information she needs about 
risks and benefits of various pharmacotherapy regimens; how to evaluate the 
advice and medical treatment plan she is given; how to comply with prescrip­
tions; how to get prescriptions changed when needed; and so on. Because 
some borderline patients are hospitalized frequently, the therapist also must 
teach the patient how to insist that new medical treatment teams consult with 
ongoing medical treatment teams before changing all of her medications. In 
DBT, it is ultimately the responsibility of the patient to make sure that she 
does not remain in iatrogenic treatments. Thus, the psychotherapist also 
teaches the patient how to get second opinions and how to find pharmacother­
apists she can work well with. The long-term goal of DBT, of course, is to 
replace medical management of behavior, including mood and cognitive 
processes, with behavioral management or self-management. For some pa­
tients, however, this is not a short-term goal. 
3. TREATING PRESCRIPTION ABUSE. When a patient is abusing 
prescription medications, this behavior is treated as suicidal behavior if the 
abuse is potentially life-threatening or is instrumental to parasuicidal be­
haviors; as therapy-interfering behavior if medication is formally a part of 
the treatment plan; and as quality-of-life-interfering behaviors if it is not. The 
DBT diary card elicits information on medications (both licit and illicit), as 
well as the patient's daily intake of each. The primary therapist should regu­
larly review this information. A patient will often decide on her own to stop 
recording medication use, saying usually that it is the same each day, and 
therefore doesn't need to be written down. The therapist should not go along 
with this. Instead, patient and therapist should work out some sort of short­
hand notation so that the patient can record the information more easily. In 
this manner, the patient can keep the therapist from knowing about medica­
tion use only by lying. 
Whether the patient lies to the psychotherapist about misuse of medica­
tions will depend largely on the therapist's response both to the misuse and 
to lying. GeneraUy the therapist should respond more negatively to lying 
and/or withholding information than to misuse. Problem-solving strategies, 
contingency procedures, and skills training procedures will be the most im­
portant approaches to changing a patient's inappropriated use of medications 
and medical consultation. Consultation to the patient rather than environ­
mental intervention (i.e., calling the pharmacotherapist) is the usual response 
to medication misuse in DBT. It is crudal, however, that the psychotherapist 
insure that every pharmacotherpist working with the patient knows about 
the DBT consultation and case management strategies. This is espedally im­
portant because the DBT approach is not the expeaed one in many commun-
--- Page 528 ---
Special Treatment Strategies 509 
ities. In a sense, then, a pharmacotherapist should be alerted to treat the pa­
tient as carefully as if the patient were not in coUateral-to-pharmacotherapy 
psychotherapy. 
A patient at risk for suicidal behavior needs help in limiting access to 
lethal amounts of medication. The general rule in DBT is that lethal drugs 
are not given to lethal people. Once patients know this rule, they are usually 
quite good about conveying it to their physicians and/or nurse-practitioners. 
The patient and therapist should discuss and devise methods of controUing 
the amount of medication avaUable and of insuring prescription compliance. 
These methods can include the use of a public health nurse, the cooperation 
of family members, the use of small prescriptions, and the use of blood or 
urine level monitoring (e.g., lithium levels) to track whether medication is 
being taken or is being hoarded. A fair amount of caution is useful here. It 
should be the prescribing physician's responsibility to setup and monitor such 
a formal program, but often the psychotherapist and patient wiU need to reach 
a working agreement within the context of managing suicidal behavior 
PROTOCOL WHEN THE PRIMARY THERAPIST 
IS ALSO THE PHARMACOTHERAPIST 
Although DBT favors separating psychotherapy from pharmacotherapy, there 
are times when this is not praaical. The patient may not be able to see some­
one else; especially in rural areas, there may not be anyone else available. Or, 
if a therapist is also a physician or nurse-praaitioner, such a separation may 
violate his or her own principles of praaice. For therapists who manage both 
psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy, DBT guidelines are as follows: 
I. KNOWING THE CURRENT RESEARCH LITERATURE. The research 
literature on pharmacotherapy of BPD is growing at a steady clip, and keep­
ing up vnth it is essential. It is important to remember that responses to specific 
medications may be quite different for borderline individuals than for others, 
even when they meet the same criteria for Axis I disorders. For example, a 
depressed borderiine patient and a depressed nonborderline patient may need 
different medication regimens; some medications increase behavioral dyscon­
trol, a special problem when treating the borderline individual (Gardner & 
Cowdry, 1986; Soloff, George, Nathan, Shulz, & Perel, 1985). 
2. ADDRESSING THE PATIENT'S HISTORY AND RISK OF SUBSTANCE 
ABUSE. Substance abuse is a special problem with borderline individuals. 
Thus, a patient may weU abuse the medications she is prescribed. This is a 
spedal problem with benzodiazepines, and for this reason they should be used 
rarely, if ever Abuse can be very difficult to detect (or, once deteaed, to con­
trol). It is one of the major reasons for separating pharmacotherapy and psy­
chotherapy in standard DBT. The prescribing therapist should intermittently 
address this issue matter-of-faaly, analyzing with the patient the faaors that 
--- Page 529 ---
510 STRATEGIES FOR SPECIFIC TASKS 
promote deception and those that favor honesty. That is, the therapist should 
help the patient analyze the pros and cons of lying or withholding informa­
tion about substance use. The therapist should periodically highlight the con­
sequences for the therapeutic relationship if the patient is not fully honest 
with the therapist. 
3. NOT GIVING LETHAL DRUGS TO LETHAL PEOPLE. Therapists 
must be very careful about prescribing drugs that patients can then use to 
overdose or commit suicide. The general principle here is that when patients 
have a history of misusing or overdosing on drugs, they should not be given 
amounts of those drugs that, if taken all at once, are harmful. For some pa­
tients, this will mean sharply curtailing pharmacotherapy; for others, it may 
mean having their medications managed by other people in their social en­
vironment; for all, it should mean prescribing small quantities and making 
prescriptions refiUable. When for financial reasons patients must buy larger 
quantities at once, a method for dispensing them in small amounts should 
be developed. 
4. DIFFUSING POWER STRUGGLES BY REFERRAL. A patients wiU 
sometimes want a medication regimen different from the one the therapist 
is willing to prescribe. If therapist and patient cannot reach an agreement 
on this issue, the therapist should consider referring the patient to another 
professional for a consultation or for medication management. The ration­
ale here is twofold. First, the therapist should accept that he or she may be 
wrong, or that there may be more than one "right" way to handle medica­
tions. Second, the therapist and the patient do not have to agree on this issue 
immediately. In the long mn, teaching the patient to utiHze medical resources 
effeaively is more important than getting the medications exaaly correct at 
this very moment. 
HOSPITAL PROTOCOL 
I. STRIKING WHILE THE IRON IS HOT 
AVOIDING PSYCHIATRIC INPATIENT ADMISSIONS 
In DBT, inpatient hospitalization is avoided whenever possible. To date there 
are no empirical data to suggest that acute, inpatient hospitalization is effec­
tive in reducing suicide risk, even when the individual is considered high in 
such risk. Nor does avaUable evidence suggest that hospitalization is the treat­
ment of choice for borderline behaviors. The DBT treatment model in this 
respect is most simUar to a rehabilitation medicine model: Therapists keep 
individuals in their stressful enviomments and go in themselves and help the 
individuals learn to cope with life as it is. The patients are strengthened in 
the situation, not out of it. In a crisis, DBT says, "Now is the time to learn 
new behavior." The notion is to "strike while the iron is hot." Taking patients 
--- Page 530 ---
Special Treatment Strategies 511 
out of stressful environments puts therapy on hold temporarily, and some­
times it actually sets back therapy. Thus, it is rarely the treatment of choice. 
2. RECOMMENDING BRIEF HOSPITALIZATION. . . 
UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS 
This bias notwithstanding, there are some situations in which the DBT ther­
apist wUl recommend or consider brief inpatient hospitalizations. These sit­
uations are listed in Table 15.8. When hospitalization is recommended, the 
therapist does most of the work involved in arranging for it; that is, he or 
she ordinarily uses the environmental intervention strategies and arranges the 
admission. The therapist should be knowledgeable about the acute psychiatric 
and emergency services in the local area, as well as thoroughly familiar with 
how to arrange for the admission of an individual patient. Each hospital will 
have its own policies and preferences. In additions, hospitals should be pri­
oritized in terms of patients' preferences. 
The therapist should discuss his or her policy on hospitalization with 
the patient during orientation to therapy. A patient may in the therapist's opin­
ion require emergency hospitalization, but may refuse to be hospitalized. This 
situation is covered by state laws regarding conditions and means of involun­
tary tteatment. Therapists should be thoroughly famiHar with their locality's 
and state's procedures; a crisis is no time to learn these. As I have said earlier, 
therapists should also know where they stand on involuntary commitment, 
and should make this clear to their patients. FinaUy, therapists should have 
readUy avaUable, at work and at home, relevant phone numbers for emergen­
cy admissions. 
3. SEPARATING THE PRIMARY THERAPIST'S ROLE 
FROM THE INPATIENT ATTENDING PHYSICIAN'S ROLE 
In standard DBT, the primary therapist does not function also as the inpa­
tient attending physician for a patient; nor does the primary therapist admit 
a patient. A therapist who wants a patient admitted to a hospital where the 
therapist has admitting privileges should find another person to admit the 
patient. The rationale here is the same as that given above for the primary 
therapist's not being the pharmacotherapist. In this case, the therapist's role 
is to consult with the patient about how to interact appropriately with inpa­
tient staff. A recurrent task will usually be to teach the patient how to com­
municate about suiddai behavior in a manner that does not unduly scare the 
staff and create negative consequences for the patient. Going around threaten­
ing suicide on an inpatient unit, for example, is usually not a very effective 
strategy. Teaching the patient how to blend assertiveness with appropriate 
cooperation, and advising her how to function in a sometimes arbitrary sys­
tem with very high power, are also common issues of consultation. A primary 
therapist who has the power efther to keep the patient in the hospftal or let 
her out, or to give or take,away privileges, cannot be a good consultant. 
--- Page 531 ---
512 STRATEGIES FOR SPECIFIC TASKS 
TABLE 15.8. Situations in Which Brief Inpatient Psychiatric 
Hospitalization Should Be Recommended or Considered 
Recommend: 
1. The patient is in a psychotic state and is threatening suicide, unless there is con­
vincing evidence to suggest that the patient is not at high risk. 
2. The risk of suicide outweighs the risk of inappropriate hospitalization. (See suici­
dal behavior strategies for further discussion.) 
3. Operant suicide threats are escalating and the patient does not want hospitaliza­
tion. The patient should not be hospitalized for escalating parasuicide unless the 
behavior represents a clear danger to health or life. (See suicidal behavior strate­
gies for further discussion.) 
4. The relationship between the patient and therapist is seriously strained, the strain 
is creating a suicide risk or unmanageable crisis for the patient, and outside con­
sultation seems necessary. Inpatient staff can be very helpful in counseling both 
parties and in assisting in repairing the relationship. A joint meeting with the ther­
apist, the patient, and an inpatient therapist should be considered. 
5. The patient is on psychotropic medications, has a history of serious medication 
abuse or overdose, and is having problems that necessitate close monitoring of 
medication and/or dose. 
6. The patient needs proteaion during the early stages of exposure tteatment of post­
traumatic stress, or during later stages that are particularly taxing. This should 
be arranged at a fuU conference of the inpatient staff. (Many inpatient staff mem­
bers are afraid of patient "regression" and do not want to or are unable to treat 
patients going through exposure treatment.) 
7. The therapist needs a vacation. Although DBT is biased against hospitalization, 
it does not advocate that the therapist become the hospital. Sometimes the pa­
tient needs so much assistance during a crisis period that the therpaist approaches 
burnout and simply needs a few days off from the patient. DBT recommends this 
as long as the therapist is honest with everyone about the reason for it. (In my 
experience, inpatient units are very wiUing to accommodate outpatient therapists 
on this point.) 
Consider: 
1. The patient is not responding to outpatient DBT and there is severe depression 
or disabling anxiety. 
2. The patient is in an overwhelming crisis and cannot cope with it alone without 
significant risk of harm to herself, and no other safe environment can be found. 
The risk to a life worth living outweighs the risk of inappropriate hospitalization. 
(This reason should be used very sparingly.) 
3. There is emergent psychosis for the first time; there is emergent psychosis there­
after, the patient cannot easUy cope with such a state, and the patient has litde 
or no social support. 
4. CONSULTING TO THE PATIENT 
ON INPATIENT TREATMENT ISSUES 
When a patient is admitted to an inpatient unit, the therapist should remain 
m the consultant-to-the-patient role unless the exceptions described m Chapter 
13 hold. The therapist should expect the patient to get passes to go to in-
--- Page 532 ---
Special Treatment Strategies 513 
dividual and skills training sessions, and to arrange for transportation and 
a travel companion if these are necessary. In our experience, once staff mem­
bers on an inpatient unit know that missing 4 weeks of scheduled treatment, 
for any reason, will result in termination of outpatient therapy, they are quite 
eager to see to it that the patient attends. If absolutely essential, the therapist 
can see the patient for individual sessions on the inpatient unit. 
When requested, the individual therapist should attend case conferences 
with the patient and inpatient staff. An inpatient treatment milieu can also 
be a good place for other large meetings with the patient, such as meetings 
with famUy members, all ancillary therapists, and/or coUateral DBT therapists. 
If a case conference is not requested but the therapist thinks one is advisable, 
the first approach should be to help the patient set up and coordinate a meet­
ing. (As I have noted in Chapter 13, this policy can backfire and create anger 
directed at the patient if the inpatient unit has not been oriented to the DBT 
consultation-to-the-patient strategies.) It is usually a good idea to stay in close 
contaa with the patient by telephone to monitor progress. I generally call 
inpatients regularly. 
Guidelines When the Patient Wants Hospitalization 
and the Therapist Disagrees 
A borderline patient often wants to be hospitalized when the therapist thinks 
k is not in her best interest. She may be in the midst of a crisis, report feeling 
suicidal, and may ask to be admitted. It can be extremely difficult in some 
situations to assess such a person's actual risk and need for hospitalization. 
In these situations, DBT guidelines are as foUows: 
1. Maintaining one's own position. The faa that a patient feels she can­
not cope outside of a hospital without killing herself does not mean that the 
therapist has to agree with her The therapist can believe (following an ap­
propriate risk assessment) that she is capable of coping and surviving, at least 
with help. 
2. Validating the patient's right to maintain her position. Conversely, 
the fact that a therapist thinks a patient can cope does not mean she can; 
the therapist may be wrong. Honesty, humility, and a spirit of willingness 
are needed here. The therapist should encourage the patient to use "wise mind" 
to evaluate the two posftions, and should support her right to maintain a po­
sition independent of the therapist's. Pretending to agree wfth her robs her 
of the opportunity to learn this. 
3. Insisting that the patient take care for herself The therapist should 
teU the patient that in this situation, she has to do for herself what she thinks 
is best for herself, even if the therapist disagrees. If she herself bdieves hospitali­
zation is important, she should pursue it. She must follow "wise mind." She 
is ultimately responsible for her own life, and she must take care for it. 
4. Helping the patient get herself admitted. The therapist should teach 
--- Page 533 ---
514 STRATEGIES FOR SPECIFIC TASKS 
the patient how to get herself admitted to an inpatient, acute care hospital 
unit. This is almost always possible, of course, if the patient goes to an emer­
gency room and says she is going to kUl herself. However, there are a number 
of less drastic options, and the therapist should consult with the patient on 
these. The therapist should be as skiUful in teaching here as he or she would 
be in teaching a therapist-preferred option. 
5. Not punishing the patient for going against advice. It is absolutely 
essential not to punish the patient if she gets herself admitted to a hospital 
against the therapist's advice. The only important thing to consider is whether 
the patient is acting in accord with her own "wise mind," rather than accord­
ing to "emotion mind" or (much more rarely) "reasonable mind." 
RELATIONSHIP STRATEGIES 
A strong, positive relationship with a suicidal patient is absolutely essential. 
Although some therapies may be effeaive with certain individuals or target 
complaints in the absence of such a relationship, or with a considerably dUuted 
one, this is not true of work with borderline suicidal patients. Indeed, the 
strength of the relationship is what keeps such a patient (and often the ther­
apist as well) in the therapy. At times, if all else fails, the strength of the rela­
tionship will keep a patient alive during a crisis. The effectiveness of many 
DBT strategies and procedures, such as cheerleading, emotional validation, 
contingency management, and both reciprocal and irreverent communication, 
depend upon the presence of a positive relationship between patient and ther­
apist. There are also times when the positive relationship wiU help the ther­
apist maintain a working alliance with the patient or prevent him or her from 
responding with hostility, fmstration, or other countertherapeutic behaviors. 
Although DBT was designed to enhance the therapeutic relationship, the 
strength of the relationship wiU reciprocaUy enhance the effectiveness of DBT. 
The relationship in DBT has a dual role. The relationship is the vehicle 
through which the therapist can effea the therapy; it is also the therapy. There 
is a dialeaical tension between these two views. The latter implies that the 
therapy will be successful if the therapist can be a certain way—in this case, 
compassionate, sensitive, flexible, nonjudgmental, accepting, and patient. 
With the provision of a relationship having these qualities, the wounds of 
the patient's past experiences wUl heal; her developmental deficiencies will 
be rectified; and her innate potential and capabUity for growth will be stimu­
lated. Control over behavior and the course of therapy in general resides 
primarily with the patient. In contrast, when the relationship is used as the 
vehicle to bring about therapy, the therapist controls therapy with the con­
sent of the patient. The relationship is then a means to an end—a way of 
having sufficient contaa and leverage with the patient to cause change and 
growth. In this view, wounds heal only because of active exposure of the pa­
tient to similar but benign situations; deficiencies are rectified by the acquisi-
--- Page 534 ---
Special Treatment Strategies 515 
tion of coping strategies; and growth occurs because it is made more reward­
ing than other alternatives. 
In DBT, a dialectic is thus intrinsic in the therapeutic relationship; the 
therapist must choose an appropriate balance between these two approaches 
at each moment. "The relationship as therapy" facilitates both acceptance of 
the client as she is and development. "Therapy through the relationship" facUi­
tates the therapist's control of behavior the patient cannot control, as well 
as the patient's acquisition of skiUs previously unknown or insuffidently gener­
alized. 
Before either approach can proceed, however, there must be a therapist-
patient relationship. Therefore, one of the goals of the initial phase of thera­
py is to develop the patient-therapist attachment quickly. Means of achiev­
ing this include the emphasis upon validation of the patient's affective, 
cognitive, and behavioral experiences; the clarity of the contract (ending sui­
cidal behaviors and building a life worth living); the focus upon therapy-
interfering behavior; outreach and avaUability through telephone calls; the 
therapist's reciprocal communication style; and problem solving of feeHngs re­
garding the relationship. Through these, the therapist nurtures the patient's 
feelings of attachment and trust. Equally important, however, is the therapist's 
attachment to the patient. If the therapist feels ambivalence or dislike for the 
patient, this wUl be communicated through omissions if not direa actions, and 
the relationship will suffer. Resolution is facilitated by the focus upon suici­
dal behaviors (which will reduce therapist stress), therapy-interfering be­
haviors, and feelings about the relationship, as well as by supervision and 
consultation. 
The therapeutic relationship is usually not as intense in other modes of 
DBT, such as skills training or supportive process group therapy. Nevertheless, 
the patient-therapist attachment is still quite important and must receive the 
same kinds of attention described above. As in individual therapy, the relation­
ship may be the only therapeutic ingredient that keeps the patient alive at times. 
Although most DBT strategies attend to and enhance the therapeutic rela­
tionship, a specific focus on the relationship is sometimes called for There 
are three particularly important issues, each marked by a relationship strate­
gy. Once again, these strategies do not require new learning, but do require 
a different integration of strategies I have already discussed. The strategies 
are (1) relationship acceptance, (2) relationship problem solving, and (3) rela­
tionship generalization. Unless a dialeaical approach is kept clearly in mind, 
the presence of such opposite techniques as relationship acceptance and rela­
tionship problem solving in the same set of strategies will seem paradoxical 
indeed. Relationship strategies are summarized in Table 15.9. 
I. RELATIONSHIP ACCEPTANCE

the quality of the patient-therapist relationship. Each is accepted as it is in 
the current moment; this includes an explicit acceptance of the stage of ther­
apeutic progress or lack thereof. Relationship acceptance, like all other ac­
ceptance strategies, cannot be approached as a technique for change—accep­
tance in order to get past a particular point. Relationship acceptance requires 
many things, but most importantly it requires a willingness to enter into a 
situation and a life filled with pain, to suffer along with the patient, and to 
refrain from manipulating the moment to stop the pain. Many therapists are 
not prepared for the pain they will encounter in treating borderline patients, 
or for the professional risks, personal doubts, and traumatic moments they 
will encounter The old saying "If you cannot stand the heat, don't go into 
kitchen" is nowhere more true than in working with suicidal and borderline 
patients. In addftion, a high tolerance for crfticism and hostile affect, and 
the ability to maintain a nonjudgmental, behavioral approach, are extremely 
important for relationship acceptance. 
To put it another way, relationship acceptance means that the therapist 
must radically enter into the therapeutic relationship, meeting the patient where 
she is just at this one moment. "Meeting the patient where she is" may be 
a trite saying, but in my consulting experience it is a stance that therapists 
--- Page 536 ---
Special Treatment Strategies 517 
of borderline patients often find almost impossible. Relationship acceptance 
is "radical" because it cannot be used in a discriminative way. Radical accep­
tance does not choose what to accept and what not to accept. Thus, it re­
quires an acceptance of the patient, of oneself, of the therapeutic endeavor, 
and of the "state of art" without distortion, without adding judgment of good 
or bad, and without trying to keep or get rid of the experience (in the mo­
ment). Another way to think of acceptance, including relationship acceptance, 
is that it is radical tmth. It is seeing the therapeutic relationship cleariy, without 
the haze of what one wants it or doesn't want it to be. From an analytic point 
of view, it is the ability to respond, both privately and publicly, without 
defense. 
One of the most important things a therapist with a borderline patient 
has to accept is that therapeutic mistakes will be made. Mistakes may be seri­
ous and may cause both patient and therapist great pain. DBT does not put 
its major emphasis on avoiding mistakes; instead, the major emphasis is on 
repairing mistakes skillfully and well. A mistake may be thought of as a tear 
or rip in a piece of fabric. A good DBT therapist is not one who never tears 
the fabric, but one who can sew well and makes good repairs. Learning that 
relationships can be repaired is possibly much more important to a border­
line patient than leaming that repairs are not needed in this particular rela­
tionship (see Kohut, 1984, for a simUar view). 
2. RELATIONSHIP PROBLEM SOLVING 
Relationship problem solving is needed whenever the relationship is a source 
of problems for either member Unhappiness, dissatisfaaion, or anger by either 
patient or therapist at the other is treated as a signal that the relationship 
needs problem-solving attention. All of the problem-solving strategies dis­
cussed in Chapter 9 are appropriate here. Relationship problem solving in 
DBT is based on the view of the therapeutic relationship as a "real" relation­
ship in which either or both parties may be the source of the problem. 
Common elements of case conferences when borderline patients are dis­
cussed are comments having to do with how a certain patient is "playing 
games," is trying to manipulate the therapist, is engaging in "staff spHtting," 
or is otherwise out to get the therapist and destroy the therapy. The assump­
tion is that if a patient is hurting, humiliating, or enraging her therapist, or 
otherwise causmg problems, she must intend such outcomes (either conscious­
ly or unconsciously). As I have stressed over and over, such reasoning is based 
on faulty logic. Therapists often feel that borderline patient have an uncanny 
ability to figure out their weak spots and attack there; I doubt it. Instead, 
I think that borderiine patients often engage in so many troublesome inter­
personal behaviors that by the law of averages they are bound to hft a weak 
spot in almost any therapist. 
Patients, of course, have a number of complaints about their therapists. 
I have discussed these extensively in Chapter 5 and wUl not go into them again 
--- Page 537 ---
518 STRATEGIES FOR SPECIFIC TASKS 
here. Most problems have to do with patient's wanting more respea, more 
emotional reciprocity, less arbitrariness, and more help. Above all, border­
line patients want to be heard. (More than one clinic patient has told us that 
our willingness to admit mistakes is one of their favorite parts of DBT.) 
The general approach to treating both therapist and patient relationship-
interfering behaviors is to approach them as problems to be solved, to as­
sume that the individuals are motivated to solve problems in the therapy rela­
tionship, and to believe that such problems can be solved. It is not assumed 
that one party or the other is primarily responsible for problems that arise. 
Such an approach will often provide a distinct change in orientation to the 
patient. The idea that the patient is trying to cause problems, rather than 
doing her best to help herself, repeats a common communication she has 
received all her life. When self-invalidating, the patient views all relationship 
problems as her own fault; at the other extreme, aware that she is doing her 
best, she may attribute aU relationship problems to flaws in the therapist. Ther­
apists sometimes show a not dissimilar tendency to blame all relationship 
problems on patient pathology. They less often attribute all problems to per­
sonal deficiencies and "countertransference." The "truth," of course, is some­
where in the middle of the dialectical contrast. 
Where and how relationship problems are discussed and solved depends 
to some extent on where the problem is taking place (group therapy or indi­
vidual therapy), what the problem is, and who is unhappy (a patient or a ther­
apist). Relationship problems in group therapy may be taken up within the 
group setting or individuaUy. (A number of faaors enter into the decision 
here, such as time constraints of the group sessions and the patient's ability to 
handle working on her own behavior within the group.) Some problems, such 
as fear or anger so extreme that the patient can not return or serious rela­
tionship mistakes by the therapist not admitted during a session (group or 
individual), are often handled in phone calls. Often, the impact of an inter­
aaion is not fully appreciated until after the session; phone calls to aUeviate 
a sense of alienation or to resolve intolerable rage are acceptable in DBT. This 
point has been discussed more fully above in conneaion with telephone 
strategies. 
Therapist behaviors that cause relationship problems are dealt with either 
in consuhation team meetings, in individual supervision, or with the patient 
in the therapy session. Complaints of the patient to the therapist about his 
or her behavior are always discussed in therapy. Usually, the key to resolu­
tion is the therapist's openness to the fact that a mistake has been made (when 
this is, indeed, the case). Although the influence of the patient's behavior on 
the therapist's behavior (and vice versa) is an important topic for the discus­
sion, the therapist must be carefiil not to turn the discussion into blaming 
the patient for the therapist's own inappropriate behavior Relationship-
interfering problems not brought up by the patient are usually solved within 
the consultation or individual supervision meetings. In these situations, the 
therapist's colleagues apply DBT strategies to the therapist.

3. RELATIONSHIP GENERALIZATION 
Generalization from the therapy relationship to other relationships is not as­
sumed in DBT. Although there are many differences between a therapeutic 
relationship and a "real" one, the therapist should use times of relationship 
difficulties and relationship problem solving to explore the similarities with 
relationships in the patient's life and to suggest how analogous approaches 
in those might be produaive. When the relationship is going well, this faa 
should also be acknowledged, and the relationship with the therapist should 
be compared to other relationships the patient is engaged in. Such a compar­
ison can highlight what the patient wants from a relationship and what is 
missing from her day-to-day relationships. All of the skiU generalization strate­
gies, discussed in Chapter 11, should be employed here. 
Concluding Comments 
The one protocol that is not included in this book is the protocol for con­
ducting the aaual behavioral skUls training with borderline patients. The con­
tent and process of skill ttaining are covered in detaU in the companion manual 
to this volume. The actual skills are described in Chapter 5, and skills train­
ing procedures for individual therapy are described in Chapter 11. By putting 
the two together, you can create your own skills training approach. The im­
portant point to remember is that whether you follow the companion manu­
al or not, a borderline patient must be taught how to respond and aa differ­
ently than she does. It is your task as a therapist to teach, coach, cajole, and 
gentiy lead her into a new way of being and behaving in this world. The strate­
gies described in this chapter are vehicles to keep the treatment frame in exis­
tence while you accomplish the necessary teaching and the patient leams how 
to be different.

Scale Points for Lethality Assessment* 
0.0 Death is an impossible result of the "suicidal" behavior. 
Cutting. Light scratches that do not break the skin; usuaUy done with pop can "puU 
tabs," broken plastic, pins, paper clips; reopening old wounds also is included at this 
level. Wounds requiring sutures must be rated at a higher level.

520 STRATEGIES FOR SPECIFIC TASKS 
Ingestion: This includes mild overdoses and the swaUowing of objects such as money, 
paper clips, and disposible thermometers. Ten or fewer ASA, Tylenol® , "cold pUls," 
laxatives, or other over-the-counter drugs; mUd doses of tranquUizers or prescribed 
medications (usually fewer than 10 pUls). Putting broken glass into one's mouth but 
not swallowing would be rated in this category. 
Other: Clearly ineffeaive aas which are usually shown by the patient to staff or others 
(e.g., going outside in cold weather with only a nightgown on after teUing parents 
she was going to commit suicide by "freezing myself to death"). 
1.0 Death is very highly improbable. If it occurs it would be a result of secondary 
complication, an accident, or highly unusual circumstances. 
Cutting: Shallow cuts without tendon, nerve, or vessel damage. These wounds may 
require some very minor sumring. Cutting is often done with something sharp such 
as a razor Very little blood loss. Scratches (as opposed to cuts) to the neck are first 
rated here. 
Ingestion: Relatively nuld overdoses or swaUowing of nonsharp glass or ceramics, events 
usuaUy brought by the patient to staff attention. Twenty or fewer ASA, laxatives, and/or 
over-the-counter meds (e.g., Sominex, Nytol® , 15 or fewer Tylenol). Small doses of 
potentially lethal medications (e.g., six Tuinal, four Seconal) are also common; fewer 
than 20 (10-mg) Thorazine tablets. 
Other: Tying a thread, string, or yarn around neck and then showing to staff 
2.0 Death is improbable as an outcome of the act. If it occurs it is probably due 
to unforeseen secondary effects. Frequently the act is done in a public setting or is 
reported try the person or by others. While medical aid may be warranted, it is not 
required for survival. 
Cutting: May receive but does not usually require medical intervention to survive. 
Examples: Relatively superficial cuts with a sharp instrument that may involve slight 
tendon damage. Cuts to the arms, legs, and wrists will require suturing. Cuts to the 
side of the neck are first rated in this category and should not require suturing. 
Ingestion: May receive but does not usually require medical intervention to survive. 
Examples: Thirty or fewer ASA and/or other over-the-counter pills; fewer than 100 
laxatives; 25 or fewer Regular Strength Tylenol; drinking of toxic liquids (12 ounces 
of less), shampoo or astringent (e.g., Ten-O-Six® Lotion), lighter fluid or other 
petroleum-based products (less than two ounces). Small doses of potenially lethal medi­
cations (e.g., 21 65-mg Darvon, 12 tablets of Fiorinal, "overdosed on phenobarbital 
but only enough to make him very drowsy," 10-15 50-mg Thorazine tablets), greater 
quantities of aspirin might be taken when staff is notified within minutes by the pa­
tient. Fourteen or fewer lithium carbonate tablets. The patient may swallow small quan­
tities of cleaning compounds or fluids such as Comet® cleanser (less than four 
tablespoons). 
Other: Nonlethal, usually impulsive and ineffective methods. 
Examples: Inhaling deodorant without respiratory distress occuring, swallowing several 
pieces of sharp glass, evidence of failed attempt to choke self with a piece of pillow­
case (e.g., rash-type abrasions). 
--- Page 540 ---
Special Treatment Strategies 521 
3.5 Death is improbable so long as first aid is administered by victim or other 
agent. Victim usually makes a communication or commits the act in a public way 
or takes no measures to hide self or injury. 
Cutting: Deep cuts involving tendon damage (or severing) and possible nerve, vessel, 
and artery damage; cuts to the neck wUl require sutures but not major vessels were 
severed. Blood loss is generally less than 100 cc. Cuts to neck go beyond scratching 
but do not aaually sever main veins or arteries. 
Ingestion: This is a significant overdose and may correspond to the lower part of the 
LDjQ range. 
Examples: Fewer than 60 ASA or other over-the-counter pills. Higher doses may be 
taken but patient insures intervention (e.g., 64 Sominex). Over 100 laxatives; 50 or 
fewer Tylenol. Potentially lethal overdoses (e.g., 60 Dilantin capsules plus half a fifth 
of rum) but done in such a way as to insure intervention (e.g., in front of nursing 
staff, telling someone within 1 hour). Signs of physiological distress may be present 
such as nausea, elevated blood pressure, respiratory changes, convulsions, and altered 
consciousness stopping short of coma. Lighter fluid (3 or more ounces); 15-20 lithi­
um carbonate tablets. 
Other: Possibly serious actions that are quickly brought by the patient to staffs atten­
tion (e.g., tied a shoelace tightly around neck but came to staff immediately). 
5.0 Death is a 50-50 probability directly or indirectly, or in the opinion of the 
average person, the chosen method has an equivocal outcome. Use this rating only 
when (a) details are vague; (b) a case cannot be made for rating either a 3.5 or 7.0. 
Cutting: Severe cutting resulting in sizable blood loss (more than 100 cc) with some 
chance of death. Cutting may be accompanied by alcohol or drugs, which may cloud 
the issue. 
Ingestion: Reports of vague but possibly significant quantities of lethal medications. 
Unknown quantities of drugs that are lethal in small dosages. . also belong here. 
Examples: "Take a large number of chloral hydrate and Doriden"; "took 60 ASA and 
an undetermined amount of other medications." 
Other: Potentially lethal aas. 
Examples: Trying to put two bare wires into an electrical outlet with a nurse present 
in the room; jumping headfirst from a car driven by staff going 30 miles an hour; 
unscrewing a light bulb in the lounge and putting finger in socket with patients around. 
7.0 Death is the probable outcome unless there is "immediate" and "vigorous" 
first aid or medical attention by victim or other agent One or both of the following 
are also true: (a) makes communication (directly or indirectly); (b) performs act in 
public where he [or she] is likely to be helped or discovered. 
Cutting: Cuts are severe. 
Examples: Eloping and "slashing neck with razor" (including severing jugular) but 
returning to hospital on own and asking for help; while alone cut head with shard 
of glass and "almost bled to death"-called doctor after cutting. Eloping and very se­
verely cutting self in a public restroom or motel—cuts led to hemorrhage shock with 
vascular collapse—patient makes direct request for help after cutting. 
--- Page 541 ---
522 STRATEGIES FOR SPECIFIC TASKS 
Ingestion: Potentially lethal medications and quantities. This would involve a dose 
which, without medical intervention, would kUl most people (usually at the upper 
end of the LDjg range or beyond). 
Examples: Eloping and ingesting approximately two bottles of ASA and then return­
ing to the hospital; 50 Extra-Strength Tylenol, eloping to motel and ingesting large 
quantities of Inderal, Dalmane, Mellaril, and three-quarters of a fifth of bourbon, 
then making indirect communication of distress; took 23 100-mg tablets of phenobar­
bital but told roommate immediately who told staff; 16-18 capsules of Nembutal— 
left note with a friend who missed the note resulting in the patient almost dying. 
Other: Lethal actions performed in a way that maximizes chances of intervention. 
Examples: Tied towel tighdy around neck—airway cut off—tried to untie it but passed 
out on floor—found cyanotic and in respiratory arrest—had seen staff making rounds 
before attempt; string wrapped several times around neck and tied to bed—face flushed 
when found. 
8.0 Death would ordinarily be considered the outcome to the suicidal act, unless 
saved by another agent in a "calculated" risk (e.g., nursing rounds of expecting a room­
mate or spouse at a certain time). One or both of the following are true: (a) makes 
no direct communications; (b) takes action in private. 
Cutting: Severe gashes with major and quick blood loss. May be partially hidden from 
staff, spouse, or friends. 
Examples: Patient went into bathroom of his room, left the door open and severely 
cut one wrist resulting in major blood loss; death would have occurred had he not 
been found 30 minutes later by nursing staff on rounds. 
Ingestion: Clearly lethal doses and no communication is made. 
Examples: Taking a lethal overdose of barbituates but vomiting before going into a 
coma; overdosed on 900 mg Stelazine in apartment alone; overdoses on phenobarbi­
tal plus alcohol, found comatose in her bed. Took 20 Tuinal and became very sleepy 
while visiting friends—the friends became suspicious and took her to emergency 
room —in coma for 36 hours; took 15 Tuinal—found unconscious at home in tub of 
warm water. 
Other: Most common here are hangings and suffocations which may or may not suc­
ceed but are performed so that a calculated chance of intervention could interrupt. 
Example: Tying belt very tightly around neck and strangling self in shower; tied shoe­
lace lightly around neck and going to bed—found at rounds to be cyanotic; blocked 
airways with plastic and had tied a stocking tightly around neck—found on top of 
her bed gurgling and pale but not cyanotic; elopes and attempts to drown self in near­
by pond but in broad daylight; jumps in front of fast-moving car (over 30 mph); plas­
tic bag over head—found deeply cyanotic; played Russian roulette and drew a "pass." 
9.0 Death is a highly probable outcome: "Chance" intervention and/or unforeseen 
circumstance may save victim. Two of the following conditions also exist: (a) no com­
munication is made; (b) effort is put forth to obscure act from helpers' attention; (c) 
precautions against being found are instituted (e.g., eloping). 
Cutting: Severe, usually multiple cuts involving severe blood loss. 
Examples: Severly cutting arm with razor and bleeding into wastebasket then got into bed (it 
was bedtime so being in bed did not arouse suspicion)—found unconscious and in shock; savagely 
--- Page 542 ---
Special Treatment Strategies 523 
biting a 2-cm piece of skin out of wrist, losing 4 pints of blood, and found in shock 
under bed covers; cut neck in arts and crafts bathroom (when shop was closed) with 
3-inch blade, found unconscious; severely cut throat with a broken pop bottle in unit 
shower—this was done when most patients were away from the unit—difficulty breath­
ing when found; cut neck and wrist in bathtub at home—died by drowning—had 
"hoped" husband would happen to discover. 
Ingestion: Clearly lethal doses. 
Examples: Drinking several ounces of nail polish remover—found covered in bed gag­
ging, pale with large amount of foaming exudate coming from mouth—mildly coma­
tose; took 30 500-mg Doriden tablets right before bedtime —in bed, appeared to be 
asleep but was actually unconscious in a deep coma. 
Other: Highly lethal means employed. 
Example: Plastic bag over head tied with a scarf—found unconscious with head in 
toilet; drove head on into a gasoline truck but survived with minor scratches and bruises; 
stuffed plastic in both nostrils and oral pharynx, completely closing airways—she ap­
peared to be sleeping in bed under covers; eloped to another city in car, tied plastic 
hose to exhaust and suffocated in parking lot; hanged self in closet with door closed— 
not breathing when cut down; jumped from 90-foot bridge into water—was uncons­
cious when found. Gunshot to chest area (if shotgun used, rate 10.0); jumped head­
first from three-story building. 
10.0 Death is almost a certainty regardless of the circumstances or interventions 
by an outside agent. Most of the people at this level die quickly after the attempt. 
A very few survive through no fault of their own. 
Cutting: Just cuts as severe as in 9.0, except that the likelihood for intervention is 
even more remote. Blood loss is severe and quick. 
Examples: Eloping to an empty house and severely cutting wrists and neck with razor-
when a policeman happened by the patient was sitting in a large pool of blood, ward­
ed off the policeman with the razor. 
Ingestion: Because of the time usually involved before a toxin can take effect, there 
are very few instances of overdosing that can be considered this serious. 
Example: Some that have been serious are [as follows]; ingesting furniture polish, paint 
thinner, and many prescription medications while alone in the house with no one ex­
pected by; overdose on large quantities of Dalmane and barbiturates with husband 
out of town and no children or other live-in companions in the household; ingested 
60 Nembutal, went into secluded, wooded area in midwinter, covered self with leaves 
which caused him not to be found for several days. 
Other: These are the most common type of attempts at this level. 
Examples: Jumping off a tall building (four or more floors); jumping in front of cars 
on a freeway and being hit; eloping and hanging self in gym locker building at night; 
secretly eloping and drowning self in lake at a time when there was no activity in the 
lake area and when he would not be expected to be on the unit; gunshot to the head 
and any effort involving a shotgun.

cents, though similar, differ in some important respeas. See Berman and Jobes (1992)

the role of "emotional processing" and exposure-based strategies in therapy. The 
theory and treatment are also applicable to shame and guilt—key emotions ad­
dressed in DBT. An understanding of the points made here is important for ap­

This book presents the rationale and methods of mindfulness practice. Although 
it is essentially spiritual in orientation, the approach is not religious. Mindful­
ness is the quality of being awake. Understanding it is crucial for teaching the 
core mindfulness skUls. The importance of "acceptance" is highlighted in the prac­

DBT is based on a biosocial theory of behavior and behavior disorder. Thus, 
it is very important to have a reasonable understanding of how biology, environ­

functioning presented by HoUandsworth is compatible with a biosocial dialecti­

including operant and classical conditioning, shaping, chaining, etc. It is espe­
cially relevant to the skills training and contingency procedures.

organized by techniques rather than disorder There is a good appendix covering 
basic principles of learning.

In J. R. NeUl & D. R Kniskem (Eds.), From psyche to system: The evolving therapy 
of Carl Whitaker New York: GuUdford Press. (Original work published in 1962) 
First-stage techniques for working with schizophrenic patients are very similar 
to the irreverent communication strategies used in DBT. This chapter is a good 
summary with lots of examples. Some of the techniques suggested by Whitaker 
and colleagues would not be used in DBT because they are too susceptible to 
abuse or insensitive use. Also, personal style is important here, and many simply 
do not fit my own style. 
Wilber, K. (1981). No boundary: Eastern and Western approaches to personal growth 
Boulder, CO: New Science Library. 
WUber presents a compelling discription of how we create polarities, boundaries, 
and parts out of the whole. Understanding of the essential unity of polarities 
and of the artificial nature of these boundaries is essential to a dialeaical view.
